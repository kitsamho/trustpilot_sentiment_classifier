The costumer service lady was really not nice. Asos have a really bad costumer service...,1,ASOS,1
Chinenye Egbe,2019-12-30T17:20:09Z,Horrid they did not deliver my item…,Horrid they did not deliver my item after over a month and they offered a silly coupon of £4.80 on an order that would cost over £25 to replace,1,ASOS,1
Menna Badawi,2019-12-30T16:04:06Z,never shopping with asos again.,this is my first and last time shopping with asos. i ordered a dress on the 28th of november and it was said to arrive by the 20th of december. it was now the 30th and no information is being provided to me by customer service as to where my package is. they expect me to wait till the 21st of january to get a refund. i no longer have use for the dress. Also the fact that the tracking that is giving is only for “asos shipping reference” (terms used by asos customer service employee) is ridiculous. i have no intention of paying for return shipping. i have never been so frustrated by lack of answers by several customer service representatives.,1,ASOS,1
Brennah Nicoll,2019-12-30T16:01:14Z,Customer service is awful,If I could give customer service no stars I would!!!! I was waiting for 2 hours for someone to reply to my problem and once they did they did absolutely bugger all!! Not okay!!!,1,ASOS,1
Matt,2019-12-31T10:36:26Z,Paid for next day delivery for a parcel…,"Paid for next day delivery for a parcel to arrive on the 21st December. Was told 3 times it would arrive on 3 separate dates, still no parcel. Spoke to about 4 different people  via the ASOS chat (all very friendly) but all said different things, turned out being a waste of time. Thanks Asos you ruined Christmas.",1,ASOS,1
Jochem Westerbeek,2019-12-31T08:41:40Z,Worst cusfomer service ever,Been waiting for 20 days now for one of my orders and after 10 e-mails I get a response with a tracking code so I can track my package as if I'm not capable of tracking a f****** package.,1,ASOS,1

Whenever the same answers, I'm really discouraged by the poor service.",1,ASOS,1
M. McDougall,2020-01-02T09:51:08Z,Item lost in the post!!!!,"Ordered a bikini for my holiday with next day delivery. Bikini did not arrive so after a week contacted Asos to find out where it was, was told to wait a further week! Still no bikini, when I contacted them again I was told it was deemed as lost & offered a replacement or refund! I really wanted the item for my holidays! Very poor service Asos!",1,ASOS,1

Melissa,2020-01-02T09:03:59Z,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE Item never sent, I’ve been ignored, no refund,","Placed order December 11th. Received shipment confirmation following day. Tracking has said pending since. It’s now January 1st. Have emailed customer service over 10 times now, only got 2 replies which I responded to then was ignored and reached out on twitter. The rep on Twitter told me I would receive a confirmation email within 72 hours on Saturday and the time has passed and it never came. Contacted another rep through chat saying she would process a refund and still nothing. This has been the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had and I strongly recommend you don’t support this company because they could end up wasting hours of your time struggling to try to get something you paid your hard earned money for. Also they just leave the chat before resolving anything. Most customer service will ask if there is anything else they can do before they just sign off the chat. 3 reps did this.",1,ASOS,1
Emma,2020-01-01T00:37:09Z,AVOID ASOS,Asos do not send all the items out that you order. They then suspend your account when you ask for the items or refund and you lose so much money. Currently waiting for over 1 hundred pounds back and it’s been 6 weeks. I kept a pair of sandals and the strap has snapped and still being ignored. I would strongly recommend avoiding ASOS.,1,ASOS,1
Kirsty,2020-01-02T21:51:53Z,Be careful of the new night time delivery service when ordering next day,"It is a shame I keep going to back to asos as sometimes it’s never easy. Their support is very scripted and never really helpful (I don’t blame the staff I blame the business and the training). My current review is more about being careful when ordering on a next day service (I pay for the premier delivery service). Asos have started using a night time only service so between 6-10pm, this obviously doesn’t work at a business address.  If I’d have known I wouldn’t have placed my order at that address. There is no option to re-route and I now have to wait until they have attempted delivery multiple times before the order is returned to Asos and then need to wait for a refund.",1,ASOS,1
customer,2020-01-02T21:17:32Z,My order was due to arrive on the 29th…,My order was due to arrive on the 29th of December. It is clearly lost and they are refusing to help me saying I have to wait til the 4th of January until they will help me! I pay for premium next day delivery and this is not acceptable. I ordered the items in good faith as I needed them for this week and one item was for a present and we are now a day after the birthday. This is really not acceptable and if I would have known I would have used another more reliable supplier. It's also insane that they are making me wait over a week from when my items should have arrived until they will help me.,1,ASOS,1
Nouran Talaat,2020-01-03T21:33:11Z,I made an order number 455096578 on…,"I made an order number 455096578 on their 26th of November, and my order isn’t delivered till now !!

First I waited for the first 3 weeka and then after sending a lot of emails they told me the order was lost, and you can replace or cancle it now . So I asked them to replace it but to a new address as no one is now in the old address in Saudi as my husband left the country . And I emailed them the new address in paris and they confirmed . They proceeded with half of the order as the sizes were out of stock. And they send the package again to Saudi Arabia . And I sent many emails telling them that this address is wrong they still refused to cancle or refund me the order . And untill today I still didn’t get the order . Honestly worst customer service worst delivery experience worst communication ! A month and I can’t get and order or have someone communicate and solve the problem .",1,ASOS,1
Parcelless_again,2020-01-03T11:10:40Z,ASOS going more and more downhill,"The customer service of ASOS and the other agencies they use are really bad. I pay for premium delivery but have on multiple occasions had problems receiving orders on time, getting the correct sizes and having missing items in my parcel. ASOS tries to scapegoat DWP for problems but it was them I was on live chat with for 45 minutes being told I had to get back in touch after midnight if I wanted to carry on trying to track down my order. I had to repeat 3-4 times that I wanted a refund before I was offered one. Service was excellent a few years ago, these days they really couldn't give a hoot if your a loyal customer or not.",1,ASOS,1
Sharvani Bell,2020-01-03T11:09:58Z,My delivery hasn’t shown up,"My delivery hasn’t shown up after several days after I paid for next day delivery. Was advised that I have to wait up to 7 more days to chase Hermes and sort this, even after I explained my circumstances above. 

No effort to help or get things sorted by the Advisor. Not happy at all.",1,ASOS,1

Emma,2020-01-03T19:47:56Z,Absolutely no explanation for why my…,Absolutely no explanation for why my parcel didn't turn up 3 times in a row. Ordered over a month ago for next day delivery that never arrived. Requested replacements that still never arrived. In the end I had to request a refund but before doing so I tried to communicate using Facebook chat as promoted on the website but didn't even get the courtesy of a response. The customer service team on the Gnatta chat facility aren't particularly sympathetic either. Really poor.,1,ASOS,1
Sharon De Sousa,2020-01-03T10:40:13Z,I bought my husband a hollister jumper…,"I bought my husband a hollister jumper for xmas, from ASOS a site that I use very frequently. Unfortunately the jumper had 2 holes in the middle of it, above the pockets and were very noticeable. I got in touch with ASOS and advised them if this, and their response was to send the package back to them for a refund. This mistake was no fault of mine and is now a big inconvenience for me to have to package and return the item to get my money back.",1,ASOS,1
Toni,2020-01-03T10:36:28Z,Disgraceful ' delivery and service'!!!,"My order was 'delivered' on 28th Dec, left on the side of the road!! I knew I would be home late that day so specifically stated please leave it in my safe porch! The delivery driver threw it on the side of the road, took a photo of it, and told me it was in a safe place!? I was horrified! I got home in the evening and hunted high and low in the dark along the whole road with NO sign of my parcel! I have continually texted, emailed and phoned ASOS but with NO definitive answer! I am SO angry by such appalling service and conduct!!! 3rd January and I'm still waiting for a reply from ASOS! Disgusting!",1,ASOS,1
Robert Salazar,2019-12-28T20:01:21Z,Horrible!,Horrible. Ordered on Dec 15 and “despatched” on 16th with estimated delivery shortly after. Package still in transit. Will never use again and trying to connect with them or UPS is a maze of hell,1,ASOS,1
Abbi ,2019-12-28T19:30:38Z,"Absolutely shocking, will never use ASOS again😡","I placed an order on the 7th December for some presents for Christmas. I received an email on the 17th to inform me that my order had been dispatched and I could track it using the Yodel Link provided.  It got up until Christmas Eve and I still had not received my delivery. After trying all day I finally got through to someone on the live chat who said there had been issues with the courier and he would reorder my items and I would receive an email with an update within 48 hours. Panicked that the presents were now not coming, I had to go out Christmas Eve and buy replacement presents.
I then received an email on Boxing Day stating that not all of my order could not be fulfilled.
I phoned ASOS to find out what was going on, only to be told my parcel had never been dispatched as it ‘is a very busy time of year’. I couldn’t believe what I was being told and requested a manager called me back the following day to explain what on earth was going on, seeing as they had taken my money on the 7th and never even dispatched my package!!!!
Surprise surprise no call back from ASOS.
Then on Saturday 28th I received a call from a supervisor claiming that the parcel had in-fact left the warehouse but somehow it had disappeared! Unbelievable.
I will never be using ASOS again.",1,ASOS,1

MN,2019-12-31T22:00:44Z,"Endless product, delivery + service issues","I used to love ASOS. Obviously, you're not getting the best made products, but stylistically they are above and beyond the best in fast fashion. However, I've had nothing but endless problems in the past couple of years. Issues with their products, delivery, things arriving damaged, and above all their lack of customer service when attempting to address these issues. In the past few deliveries, some of the issues I've encountered have been..

-- Sending back over $250 worth of clothes (with their return label and in ASOS packaging) and being told they never received them. I was out $250 and no clothes to show.

-- Most recently, received a package full of clothes covered in a skincare product I ordered from them which was put in the package with zero protection. The bottle broke and leaked all over the clothes.

-- Consistently I've paid for next day delivery and it does NOT arrive the next day. This is particularly annoying / upsetting when I'm sending friends and family birthday gifts from abroad.

Obviously things happen, but what really disappoints me me is ASOS's complete lack of customer service. I've not so much as received a discount code, a 10-20% back for the constant inconvenience/damaged order... OR worst of all, an apology.

Get your act together ASOS. You've lost a decade long customer.",1,ASOS,1
Hannah Tanuto,2019-12-31T18:04:43Z,Dissatisfied,"Don’t even deserve a star for your rubbish customer service & delay. Lost a loyal customer!!! Full order didn’t receive, didn’t get an email in regards to it. I email them to let them know & didn’t get a proper response till a week later, only to say that most of my items are now out of stock. Ask for refund as it’s now taken them over a month to send my order, they said no cause the order has been packed, yet 3days later & still haven’t received an email about it being dispatched!!! Never buying form ASOS again, my experience has really put me off from future purchases.",1,ASOS,1
Consumer,2019-12-27T13:54:04Z,Worst customer care team,I ordered my parcel and paid for next day delivery so it would be here on Xmas eve in time for Christmas. I left delivery instructions for the parcel to be left in the porch. The dpd driver Harnek  didn’t bother to read the instructions left for the driver and decided to take a picture of my drive. I assume he didn’t even get out his van as there was no sorry we missed you card just a text sayin your delivery won’t come until after Christmas. I tried calling multiple numbers which were all automated voices and no help I phoned ASOS direct and got put on hold then hung up on. I was told I can’t collect it from their depo as the delivery address on my ASOS account had my partners name on with the same address. So after trying everything I could to receive this parcel I gave up as not one person seemed like they wanted to help. I had no choice but to wait for my parcel to be delivered today then get a text today (Friday 27th) saying your parcel will be delivered on Saturday 28th! I did not request this and this is now becoming extremely frustrating. I phoned ASOS to see why this has changed and they put me on hold then hung up on me. I phoned dpd and they told me they can’t help my parcel won’t come today and that ASOS has changed the delivery to tomorrow. I can not be bothered to be put on hold for ages then get hung up on or speak to people that have no intentions to help this is the worst customer care team I’ve ever spoken to and it’s such a shame as I did like ordering from ASOS but after this I won’t be and will send my items back.,1,ASOS,1

And I ordered it 2 months ago !! And can’t even offer compensation!! I don’t even care about the compensation as much as I do the dress. I love that dress and can’t believe you guys took so long to replace it that it sold out. I told you yes replace it and you continued to keep messaging me asking if I want a replacement then it was sold out. Ridiculous!!! Poor poor customer service I can’t believe it.,1,ASOS,1

Jenna,2020-01-02T00:38:15Z,If you ask for a refund,"If you ask for a refund, even if you return the wrong item they sent to you, they BLOCK you from their order system and you can't order again from them. This a real SHAME. I don't know why e-shops like you and DP have this strategy, but be sure that you are going to lose many clients in this way. You make the mistake but you block us from shopping again from you: paranormal, isn't it?",1,ASOS,1
John Cooke,2019-12-31T07:58:23Z,As other people have stated,"As other people have stated, I have ordered 2 next day delivery parcels, and received one, the other has not arrived in 3 days. All customer service has to say is to wait in a rather patronising way. I have waited and still no sign of me order, would rather be told its missing than have to sit here listening to the same response to wait until the end of the day, conveniently at a time in which its impossible to do anything about the order as it will be too late.",1,ASOS,1

Taree Reardon,2020-01-01T20:52:19Z,Shipment Not Received,"I am very disappointed as my shipment was not delivered on time, and as of today still hasn't been delivered at all. The representative I spoke with on 12/30 swore that the package would be delivered yesterday (12/31) even though FedEx had already confirmed that the package was lost. The representative refused to do anything to assist me, and the package wasn't delivered. 

Today I spoke with a differed representative who was better, however he advised me that I would need to pay for expedited shipping on future orders in order to receive them on time. The delivery date I received when I ordered was 12/31/19, and when the package initially shipped it had a delivery date of 12/27/19 before it was lost. I shouldn't have to pay extra for shipping just to receive my item. I don't think I will be ordering from your company again and will advise others not to as well.",1,ASOS,1
Sagi Sharon,2020-01-03T09:29:07Z,NEVER ORDER PRODUCTS FROM ASOS!!! BE CARFUL!!!!!!!,"Don't buy from them-
Unprofessional service and store!!!

 I bought two products on black friday from Asos. After more then a month, when I asked the costumer service to find out why is the delivery is taking so long- they told me that there' s been a problem with the delivery and my two orders cancelled and I'll get a refund.

That is basically just the person and compeny that should give you the products that you've been waiting for, just telling you-
""No products. And we don't care, just take the refund"".

When a store doesn't give you any of the product that you ordered- you realize it is unprofessional.",1,ASOS,1
Sohema Patel,2020-01-03T19:17:18Z,I am really unhappy with the service…,"I am really unhappy with the service received. I requested an exchange and was given a refund. I purchased an item on Black Friday so I lost the discount price now! 
I’ve emailed them prior to returning for exchange and followed the advice given.
I then wrote to them several times and got robotic replies about the item being out of stock when I regularly checked on the website and was able to put it in my basket. 
I’m soooo dissapointed and feel like I was played by Asos. Was offered a 15% discount but that doesn’t even cover half discount I had. I asked for it to be matched but was refused. 
Communicating has beeeeen sooo hard with ASOS. Chats takes ages and emails have really delayed responses. 
I don’t blame people for abusing retailers like Asos. I Was honest and followed procedures but I lost out.

On the first few occasions I used the standard delivery and discovered that this takes 2 weeks! Every time! I then tried next day delivery, paid for the year of premier delivery and even using this it wouldn’t be dispatched from ASOS themselves for about 2/3 days on average after ordering! The next things I ordered I ordered the same day about 10 minutes apart from Adidas and  Tommy Hilfiger, I have since received and returned some items from both Adidas and Tommy Hilfiger with no sign of my ASOS package, two weeks post order. This will be my last ever order from ASOS.

Naomi French,2020-01-02T18:08:03Z,Terrible Customer Service. Shop at Nordstrom instead.,"The customer service is the worst of all brands I shop with. The returns process is a mess and I've had returned items show as delivered to their warehouse that they can't track down for months and then it took another month of fighting with customer service to get a refund. Apparently Asos has no way of tracking your returns using their included return shipping label and they take forever to process returns so if you return a package within the returns window, but they dont process your return until after the window is up, they'll deny your refund. You always have to have proof of when your return was delivered to their facility. The customer service is a mess so even in the same email thread you'll talk to a different person every time and they have a hard time keeping track of your situation. You can't escalate an issue whatsoever and there is no phone number to call to actually speak to someone. My last order said everything was delivered, but was missing an item. The inventory selection is nice, but if you have have any order issues whatsoever or want to return anything you're in for a real nightmare. Save yourself the hassle and shop somewhere that actually has customer service, like Nordstrom.",1,ASOS,1

I paid for next day delivery only to wait for 2 weeks for Asos and DPD to carry out an investigation for a parcel that was obviously delivered to the wrong place and signed by the wrong person. There is proof for it, still, they have to investigate, not making me chase something I paid for to recieve the mest day, but also telling me the delivery company doesn’t consider themselves liable and I might have to pay for something someone else recieved.

D,2019-12-28T13:13:19Z,THE worst customer service,"I had THE worst experience with ASOS this last order.
My order never showed up and I couldn’t get a hold of anyone to help make it right FOE A MONTH.
$144 is a lot of money to spent on winter essentials to not even have them. I chose ASOS on Black Friday over other stores and I wish I would have chosen another place to give my business so I could have the items in a timely manner.
People took DAYS to respond to my emails (which is THE only way to communicate with them apparently).
After a month of trying to get my items they finally gave me my money back. Thank goodness because that was the ONLY close to good thing to come out of this. So basically, my money was basically held hostage for a month and I got nothing to show for it. They didn’t even offer me a discount code or anything.",1,ASOS,1
Harry,2019-12-28T12:54:49Z,Customer Care is terrible,"I enjoy shopping from ASOS. There’s good prices and usually I have no problems. However, recently I ordered an item and payed £5.95 for next day delivery. The item arrived today and when I opened it I realised that it was completely different to what I ordered. As I payed for next day delivery you can see my frustration with this issue.

I decided to speak to customer care to see what could be done about this and I spoke to an assistant called NIMAT. I explained the situation and was told that I needed to return the item and a refund would be given to me. I then asked how long this would take and was told 7 days and I would receive the refund after it has been spent back. Then I told them how much it was including shipping. However, I was then informed that I would not receive a refund for the delivery my order “was delivered on the estimated date”. Which it was, but my order wasn’t delivered... an item that was nothing to what I wanted was delivered. So anyone would expect a full refund as the issue was caused by the supplier. I explained this to NIMAT and was just told the same thing.

I wanted this item for New Years and now because ASOS made a mistake I won’t have it now for that time. I’m well aware this may sound petty but it’s not the fact that I won’t receive my money or the fact that I have to go out of my way to return the item, it’s because ASOS has a duty of care to all its customers and I feel like today that wasn’t met. 

I hope that no one else has to go through this and I just wanted to share my experience so people can understand. Finally, probably the thing that annoyed me the most was that NIMAT who was supposed to be there to help with my issue ended up ending the chat when I tried asking him another question.",1,ASOS,1

Been in contact with ASOS live chat a few times. Just keep getting told to wait longer (now 31st) due to processes out of their control. No replacement offered until then apparently.",1,ASOS,1

Contacted to tell them about missing items asked if I wanted s refund or replacement.  Said replacement as yoh haven't sent them.  Latter that day recieved an email stating account blocked and advising to seek refund through payment provider.  I have tried to contact customer care on numerous occasions explaining that bag was not big enough for two pairs of trainers and the trainers are out of stock on website but they are not interested.  I understand that this is not an isolated case with ASOS.  I wonder how many people it has fraudulently taken money from and not supplied goods.  I am now waiting to see if my card company will reimburse my money but even if it does this is scandalous. Set of thieving bs,1,ASOS,1

Soon as I received the text we checked in all the usual places and the order had not been received. This was on the 11th December. I sent a message to ASOS to confirm this information and after having to confirm my address and that I had checked and confirmed the parcel was not in any of the locations they asked for. I then had a second email asking to confirm these things again. I have finally had an email on the 27th December confirming that I will be able to receive a refund, hopefully this will be completed. I appreciate it is a busy period over Christmas, but I do not have the money especially at this time of year to buy 2 presents for my sister so she has now had no present from me on her 30th birthday.

If I could give 0 stars I would! This has been the worst customer support I have ever dealt with. I am trying to find out how to get my tracking information for a return so I know when I would get my refund. What I dealt with was the customer rep trying to argue what 10 business days were and that I needed to find proof of postage. First off, regardless of the time period, they could not tell me how I would need to get proof of postage when using the return label that was provided to me in the shipped item. When they could not provide more detail instructions, I confronted with a passive-aggressive, rude customer rep who would be told me that no one could help me. I kept asking for clarification and asking what could be done if I used the return label that was provided by ASOS. 

I dealt with shipping items on a daily basis and what they told did not make sense for US customs. Clearly, they did not understand the difference between the two cultures. 

If ASOS is going to have customer service reps like this, they have lost my business and future businesses. This is ridiculous; I am just trying to get a refund on a small previous purchase, which shouldn't be this difficult.",1,ASOS,1

Today is December 23 and I don’t have the item which supposed to be gift and you sadly offering me £71.50 refund which you will give me in 10 working days! This is not fair!
I keep contacting Asos via phone and messenger. Some of the communications some you don’t even have a record of. On the 19th of December I contacted you via messenger where you replied to me and ask me if I would like to refund or replacement. As the speaker was available, I selected replacement. No one contacted me from Asos and I had to chase you a few times over the phone and messenger wasting a lot of time. Christmas is approaching and I don’t have a gift which I need for tomorrow.

To be fair, I think the issue was with Hermes the delivery firm. I ordered on 14/12 and order was expected 19/12. 

I appreciate it's near to Christmas and everyone will be busy, however, having to use chat & twitter for updates wasn't ideal and I'm told that if it doesn't come by today 30/12 then at least I can get a refund or a replacement 🤔🤔🤔.  

I guess it teaches me a valuable lesson, don't buy Christmas presents via ASOS and don't expect them to care if anything goes wrong

I guess I can go and buy a late Christmas present from a bricks and mortar store now and hopefully at a discount in the sales...hey ho, every cloud #ASOS #HERMES

My coat was now falling to bits so I got in touch via the live chat, hoping to get a refund as the coat was now out of stock. The person I was speaking to was clearly reading from a script and was not amenable, asking i send back the coat so they could inspect it. I explained I was unable to do this as I don’t have another coat, so I sent pictures of the faults. I was still told that I would need to send the coat back for inspection (it’s 31st December and very cold...!) I suggested I would need to get the coat repaired and this would incur a cost. ASOS reluctantly agreed to help cover the costs of this, provided I do this myself and send a receipt. What a joke. I’ve already waited weeks with no response to get this quit frankly poor and unhelpful result, with no other compensation for the other time and resource this has incurred on me.

When I received the shoes, they were a size 8. This is absolutely not acceptable as this is not what I ordered. These were a Christmas gift and I needed them before December 24. They advised me that my only option was to return the incorrect shoes, wait for a refund, so that (in my financial situation) I would have the funds to repurchase the same size of the same shoe in hopes that I would receive the correct size.  I ordered the correct size to begin with and felt punished by having to return, wait for my refund in order to have the funds to re-order. I didn't do anything wrong in placing my order and yet was made to feel like it was my fault.  I will now be just returning the shoes and try to find a similar promotion elsewhere to repurchase.

When I got my package I sent them pictures of what was entered on  my order and what was put on my package, and all they said was sorry you you expected it sooner. They responded that it's out of their control. How is what they entered as a shipping address not within their control? 

Also CANADIAN shoppers - they do offer a discount to offset the duties, but it is buried in their website and not something they will honor if you miss it after placing the order but before it was shipped. I paid $52 in duties for a $170 dollar order...

Hi Sarah,

So sorry that you are worrying that your order might not turn up. 

I've checked and can see your order is being delivered by TRAKPAK  and is due to arrive by 10/12/2019 .

Tracking isn't available on this delivery - but don't worry, it's on its way. If you haven't received your order by 10/12/2019 , please get back in touch.

I hope this is of some use to you. Hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend.

Best Wishes,

ASOS Customer Care

the 10th came and went and still no dress. So I contact customer service again on the 13th and they tell me to check my post office and see if it's with a neighbour (it's an office building so that wouldn't happen).  But I followed up with the postal service anyway and they couldn't find anything associated with the TRAKPAK number. 

so a week after the delivery date I contact customer service again only to be told that the expected delivery was changed to December 31st. I was never notified of this, I was told 2 days before the original expected date that everything will be fine. 

Well the 31st is too late, I ordered a month in advance to avoid bullsh** like this. I contacted customer services before the delivery date to BE SURE things were fine, and STILL I get lies and incompetence. I did everything in my power as a customer (save for paying 30$ for express shipping) to prevent this late minute emergency on my part but ASOS didn't play their part. They failed and strung my around and screwed me over.

This was my first and last time ordering from ASOS. Their incompetence and lack of communication has turned me off from the company and I will be a loud ambassador of why you should shop there.",1,ASOS,1

Responses to my messages on Twitter took many hours and attempting to work with them wasted an incredible amount of my time. Their responses were condescending and they never took responsibility for selling faulty products. The ASOS representative (or more likely multiple representatives) who were messaging me always tried to shift the blame for my faulty boots elsewhere.

Harassed by asos,2019-12-25T16:33:19Z,I spoke to agent chloe,"I spoke to agent chloe. Extremely unhelpful and robotic. My same day delivery order that I paid extra for did not arrive in the time frame. The parcel was attempted to be delivered 2 days late but I had left for the holidays and had asked it to be rejected. Now I receive emails that the parcel has been received on the 22nd and there is no signature. 
I take this up with ASOS and while I’m chasing ASOS customer care as they refuse to reply for some strange reason, I receive an email on the 24th that my order is on the way to be delivered. Then miraculously it is delivered and signed by someone. 

How can there be apparently “two” deliveries made on the same order?
If accordingly to city sprint the order was delivered on 22nd (as updated on the tracking) then what was delivered on the 24th (and the tracking shows the job was created on the 24th)

It seems like city sprint lied. They never delivered anything and when they were contacted by ASOS they decided to pretend to deliver once again. 

When you paid close to 10£ for a single delivery, you want your order to be delivered when you need it! Not when ASOS decides to send it... and if they had to then they don’t need to scam customers of their hard earned money by charging more!

Trust me guys, don’t go for ASOS express delivery. It’s a scam.

Lisa,2019-12-19T13:04:53Z,"ASOS IS A DISGRACE, ESPECIALLY DURING CHRISTMAS!","Tbh I wouldn’t even give 1 star. I wouldn’t give them anything. THE EMAIL IVE RECEIVED FROM THEM IS DISGUSTING!
I’ve been shopping on ASOS for years!!! I’ve been a loyal customer and it’s always been a “go to”. There would be times where I received bad customer service or they forgot to send bits of my order but I always shopped from them. However recently I placed an order for some clothes for Xmas and some Dr Martens that I’ve been trying to get for ages and I found they had 1 size in stock which is a size smaller which I usually go for but I thought they stretch out anyway! I received my order the next day but my DrMartens were not included? I immediately contacted Asos via Live Chat and told them and she was happy to either give a refund or replacement. I REALLY wanted the DMs but when I checked online they were all out of stock. I did explain I would love a replacement but I’m not sure if it’s possible as they’re out of stock. She assured me that she would pass over my details onto stock team and usually receive stock regularly. I was abit annoyed as I specifically got next day delivery because of the boots but I thought it was fine. I received an email yesterday from them( bare in mind Christmas is NEXT WEEK) basically telling my account is blocked and anything returned back will not be refunded. They are also basically accusing me of LYING saying that “it’s rare items go missing from ASOS”. 
I am now unable to contact them, make another account or get a refund for £210 DR MARTENS THAT I NEVER RECIEVED. I also had to return a couple hoodies from that order a couple days so now I won’t be getting a refund for that either. Nearly £300 I won’t be getting a refund for. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS!!! They just completely blocked me without me having any say in this it’s disgusting. During Christmas too. Terrible.",1,ASOS,1

They have a policy that says once they receive it at the warehouse, the customer has to wait 10 ADDITIONAL days for them to ""process it at the warehouse"". Still, after the 10 days I've had to contact them to initiate the refund. They rarely get back via email so it's better to use the live chat feature on the website.

l3ushy,2019-12-21T21:48:40Z,Horrendous courier company.,"Maybe not a bad review of ASOS, but more the courier service they are using, myhermes. They have been absolutely dire from start to finish, and we have still not received our parcel, which was a Christmas present that evidently we will now not get.
To begin with we were sent the wrong item by ASOS. After trying to sort this for over a week, they still didnt manage to issue us a code for the product we wanted, bought at the same price as listed on the Black Friday sale. We sufficed for just getting a refund and bought the original product more for more than it was listed for when we bought it on Black Friday. ASOS still haven’t rectified this. 
So when we reordered, we found it was being delivered by MyHermes. Apparently they made an attempt to deliver but this was clearly not true. After wasting my whole day inside waiting, for them to say they had attempted at the end of it, was an absolute joke. We contacted myhermes via live chat and phone, livechat insisted they would pass on my phone number to the courier so we could direct them to the property if they found it difficult (it isn’t difficult) which evidently did not happen, no call. I called myhermes and was greeted by the most vile human in the world. I explained I understood it was a busy time of year but surely they should have measures in place for this, overall the man was just rude and spoke over me the whole time despite me being understanding. I expressed my concern of not receiving my package. He showed little interest and assured me he would pass on my number to the courier.
Anyhow,
Here we are again. Email saying it has been delivered. It hasn’t and we did not give permission for our package to be left anywhere, especially in our non existent ‘porch’. 
Both ASOS and my Hermes have lost my custom. This is a formal complaint and I wish for it to be responded to by the complaints procedure.",1,ASOS,1

I then asked for their complaints email and tweeted them asking them to respond. Their response was ‘if you want the items order again’ to which I responded that was very unhelpful, I was then just sent another 15% off voucher ‘to make it up to me’ (I can’t use these together and I can’t use them on sale items either) basically, they held my money for two weeks, gave me no update and then tried to fob me off with a 15% discount code when you can get 10% codes online for free.

Slow replies. With no answers to my questions. Generic answers missing the point. I have spent alot over the years with ASOS but the way they have handled this last order was terrible. Never again.",1,ASOS,1

On Dec 19 I found out they lost it... but none notified me, I had to reach out to customer service to know. The tracking number never worked. No solutions that could fix the issue were offered to me. My bother won’t have his jacket for Xmas because of the terrible service ASOS provided. The worst was to hear that it was my fault because I should have contacted before... 
The only solution was to buy again the jacket in asos.es (but even though, the jacket won’t arrive on tîme) Also, I had to pay more as ASOS didn’t offer me any discount that matched the price I paid on ASOS.co.uk. So apart from not getting the jacket on time, I had to spend more money. I won’t buy on ASOS again. I don’t recommend it to anyone.",1,ASOS,1

For that they get 4 starts. However.....I ordered an item for Christmas and a couple of days later I got an email that it ""was returned and credited"".  Funny, I never got it to return!  Then, 7 hours later I got an email that it was shipping.  There was even tracking info with DHL.  4 days before Christmas and customer service tells me they couldn't ship.  Then why was I told it shipped and why did DHL have an active tracking number?  I should have gotten an email that the order was cancelled due to lack of inventory or whatever.  I asked for a courtesy credit to encourage me to reorder and this was not available.  This would have gone along way to have made me feel better about this.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this provider.",1,ASOS,1

natalie mclean,2019-12-21T12:45:46Z,Wrong item sent,After being a customer of ASOS for many years I have been completely disgusted with customer service I received today! I order a trouser suit for my mum for a wedding next week and ordered next day delivery with it being the Christmas period. She received 2 pairs of trousers instead of pants and jacket! When I called them up to tell me I was told that the pants would have to be sent back first before they send out the jacket even though this was their mistake. Even though I explained to them it is Christmas week and I would never receive the jacket in time for when it was needed they do not care and said my only other option was to ORDER AND PAY for another jacket right before Christmas and wait for the money to be refunded once they receive the trousers. I am absolutely disgusted in this customer service they refused to let me speak tk a manager regarding this and could only do a complaint via email.

I called the Asos team and they said that they can’t give me a refund until I return the item and that I have to PURCHASE the dress again. But guess what? The size I wanted was out of stock. The person I spoke to did not care at all. I ended up purchasing another size and they said that I’ll be getting a refund within 7 working days. It is now the 21st of December. Where is the refund?

The dress was completely different to what it shows on the photo online. In the title it claims to be a mini dress but when I walked down the hallway with it on it touched from wall it wall it was huge. If you want to return anything it’s going to take 17 days to have the money put back into your account. I now have to cancel my 18th birthday plans as I don’t own any dresses and have used the last of my funds on Christmas shopping. I carefully planned everything but what I didn’t plan on was ASOS not being a trusted website. 
Not only that but I got in contact with an ASOS worker through their chat to ask about the returns. It took an entire hour of slow robotic messages for her to say that I “just need to return it” . She did not touch on the fact it was falsely advertised stating “I understand it didn’t work out FOR YOU”  and they didn’t want to see photos of the real thing either when I offered. Not a single care. It is physically a completely different dress anybody who would’ve bought it would be spewing too it’s not about the lighting or the sizing the dress itself it not what it shows on the photo. Horrible experience, horrible outcome my birthday is in a few days. Zero help or sympathy from ASOS.

They are not willing to investigate false advertising through their site. That dress is still on the market for the next person to be disappointed.

Alex Foster,2019-12-18T10:14:54Z,Failed delivery - No help available,"I ordered this suit to arrive at my office, paying for next day delivery. The following morning I logged in to track my order and could see it had an alert and was delayed by a road closure, but it was on it's way. At around10:30AM, a delivery arrived at my office containing lots of different Asos orders for many different people, but none of them were mine. This was concerning, as it indicated that all Asos orders to my office address had been grouped together and mine had been missed. I checked back on the tracking system and this time I noticed a discrepancy. My parcel was processed by the depot by 8:22AM, it was on it's way at 8:42AM. It was then back in the depot again at 10:42:AM. Then it was back out on it's way again at 11AM. In between the hours of 8:42AM and 10:42AM, is when all of the other deliveries arrived at my office. In addition, my parcel had been 'on it's way' from my local depot since 11AM. Nothing changed on this delivery status till I pursued this further at 3PM. By this time, it was clear to me that something had gone wrong. The item had been on its way for over 4 hours. All other Asos orders had also been delivered to my office in one parcel earlier today, just not mine. And the status hadn't been updated in over 4 hours, indicating it was simply stuck in the back of the van. I realised this, so tried to get in contact. I first called Hermes, but was advised by them that it was the responsibility of the Merchant, so to get in touch with Asos. I then got on live chat with Asos and described the situation to the agent. I explained to them that I was sure that a problem had happened with my delivery (and why) and it needed chasing up because it was crucial I had my suit today, as it is my work Christmas party. I explained that Hermes had told me it is Asos's responsibility to chase up and find info relating to my parcel. I asked if the agent could call Hermes because of this. I was told this would not be possible by the agent, as Aoso don't have a number for Hermes. This is an outright lie. I asked to speak to a manager, but I was told that this wouldn't be possible either and then the chat was disconnected by the agent.I was, in essence, hung up on. I then got in contact with Hermes again via livechat. I explained the situation once again. I explained that I needed to know if it was going to arrive or not, as otherwise I would need to go out and try to buy a new suit before shops shut. This time, I was told by the Hermes agent that my parcel would be delivered by 8PM. I asked the Hermes agent if they could 100% guarantee this and I was told that yes, it would be with me by 8. I also asked if it would be possible to re-direct my parcel so I could wait at home, but I was told no. This was slightly frustrating, as it meant I had to wait at my work address for 3 hours past the end of my shift. But I waited, as I had been given full confirmation that it would be with me that evening. I waited until 8:25PM, and no suit arrived. This is not acceptable. I spotted the problem with my delivery before 3PM and reached out to both Hermes and Asos to report this. No one would listen and responsibility was passed from one party to the other. When I did finally speak with someone, they gave me their word that it would be with me by 8PM. I stayed at work 3.5 hours later than the end of my shift. I didn't purchase an alternative suit as I had confirmation that I would receive the one I purchased. All of this could have been avoided if someone listened to me when I tried to make contact in the first instance.",1,ASOS,1

I ordered from ASOS on the 3rd of December and chose the next day delivery option. Haven't got any update since from them and have been contacting customer service daily using chat online. Their service was so rude, advicing me to wait until end of each day and if there isn't any progress to contact back in the next day!! I have to apparently wait until the end of 4th working day AFTER MIDNIGHT to contact for a possible refund. But I chose the NEXT DAY DELIVERY OPTION!! The worst bit of the whole experience is I was told off that there is nothing they could do to advice as it was MY FAULT THAT THE LATE DELIVERY BANNER WAS POSTED ON ASOS ON 28 NOVEMBER 2019. I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD READ BEFORE I ORDER IN THE FUTURE. The customer service analyst was also very eager to close the chat and was very sarcastic throughout the conversation.

Rosie,2019-12-24T15:06:05Z,Why do i pay for premier delivery?,"In my experiences with Asos I have struggled to see that they value their customers loyalty. Having had premier delivery for a year, I don't understand how they get away with not providing the service they promote. Multiple times throughout this year i have not received parcels on the next working day, due to 'Transit problems' due to the courier, that were 'out of their control'. And having complained about each and every delay, the lack of compensation or acknowledgement for Asos' clearly major problem is astounding. The job of the consumer should not be to present these logistical errors to the retailer, Asos should identify these problems and rectify them without the customer having to wait in a queue to 'chat' to someone or send an email and get a response in the next '24 hours'. Asos should offer reasonable compensation for their mistakes and not allow the customer to feel cheated for paying for something they do not receive. But having complained about paying £9.99 for something i do not receive, Asos replied with their T&Cs stating the potential for delays. Following this, the chat was ended without my choice of giving a reply. And this 'Chat' service was only used following no response from an email i sent more than 24 hours before.",1,ASOS,1

I literally contacted the day i got shoes and sent them picture of defect right away. Asos wants me to pay for their fault waste my money and time because they don’t check their items before sending so they can earn easy money. Of course no one would pay for the shipping cost of overseas postage. This is how asos force sell their items with faulties.

I ordered some items that I was in love with! Apparently they were damaged while being shipped so the delivery partner would not complete the delivery. I was told to reach out to Asos. When I reached out I was met by one of the rudest reps I've ever experienced. In the end, she basically told me I'd be refunded once they received the package. No discount for the inconvenience or even an actual email to notify me that the issue even arose. I found out because the package did not come when it was guaranteed to be delivered. After speaking with her I emailed Asos to let them know about the experience I had with the rep & to validate her response. It was over the holidays so i expected them to take a while to respond. I never received a response. After over a month passed, i reached out again to let them know I still haven't received my refund & the tracking status is still showing as damaged at the same location it was over a month ago. This rep was kinder, however, it felt like I was being dodged. He told me that he was sorry for my inconvenience & that they were able to issue a refund & I should receive an email confirmation in 48 hrs. After he sent the email he ended the chat. Without me being able to respond or ask any questions. I'm hoping I actually do receive an email confirmation for my refund.

It puts lovely people like Anita in harm's way as they take the brunt of the frustration and outrage experienced when being told that there's nothing anyone can do, particularly at this time of year.

I then spoke to a Kamran on the live chat who said I needed to wait until midnight that day to see if it got delivered (even though the shop I was collecting from shut at 11pm) 
Surprise, the order didn’t get delivered. I then started a live chat with Jordan who then told me my items may not get delivered until 31st December! I asked them a few questions and they did was blame their courier. I asked if I could cancel the order so I can go elsewhere and buy an outfit and he closed the chat! Quite possibly the rudest customer service I have ever received and it’s put me off from ordering from ASOS again!

The first time I thought was just bad luck but after this time , I will never shop on ASOS again or recommend it to anyone. First experience involved me sending it to another address that was not convenient to me, I notified ASOS and they said it was too late so I go and pick it up from the address and low and behold IT WAS NOT THERE. I told ASOS someone took my package , but instead of offering me a replacement package, they told me I need to notify the police. And what about the money I spent ASOS? Nope they don’t care. Second incident is that they send me an item that’s faulty and they sent the wrong size. When I asked them for some sort of compensation, Tara kept insisting that I return the package. The item is out of stock so returning the package means I would lose the item. I liked the shoes and would have been okay keeping them if I wasn’t paying full price for them. I tried to explain that to her and she stated the only way I could get my money back is by returning the item. I then asked to speak to a manager to which she stated she “couldn’t do” because they have protocols they need to handle and then rudely ended the chat on me . Even shein refunded me when their item was faulty . Waste of money. I rather just buy the items from the companies themselves than support an industry with no customer service.",1,ASOS,1

I planned on it but I asked if they do an exchange and they said no, that you have to repurchase the items if you want them before they issue you a refund. I said fine whatever...since your company made the mistake can I have a coupon code to get the shoes at the same price I originally paid? The said a ""special department"" does the coupons and that they would review it and send me one but it would take 24-48 hours....how fricken ridiculous that the customer service agent couldn't just give me one since they screwed up. I ANXIOUSLY waited for them to contact me to give me the coupon code because both pairs of shoes are limited stock in the size I was supposed to receive originally. I was emailed by them today that they will not be giving me a coupon code until the shoes are returned to them which can take up to 10 days according to them. 10 DAYS!!!!! I'm scared to death that the shoes will be sold out by then and all because ASOS doesn't care about their customers at all. These were meant to be Christmas presents and because of how they're being I doubt I will even be able to get the shoes at all. I am absolutely appalled that they treat their customers like this, I only tried them because I've seen YT influencers shop with them often and recommend them. I am WARNING everyone  I know to run, do not order from them, they screw up and don't care. They just want your money and expect you to spend more money to fix their mistakes. I was originally upset they just wouldn't do an exchange but fine whatever I got over it and just said give me a coupon code so I can hurry up and order the shoes before they're sold out, but they essentially said F U. Please please please do not shop with this company. BEWARE!!!!!

I made a large order for next day delivery, due to be delivered on Friday. Friday came and went and I had absolutely nothing, no communication at all. I checked the order number on Hermes and there was an update saying my order was delayed. On Saturday morning I got a text to say my order was out for delivery and then later that it had been delivered. When I got home I checked the delivery to find there was a large amount missing and no communication from ASOS to say that anything was being delivered separately. 

I spent the next few days trying to get an answer from ASOS but the social media staff just kept asking what items were missing. On Monday I checked the Hermes tracking again and there was an update saying “there’s been an issue with your delivery, please contact sender”. I used the chat option and after answering several very unnecessary questions about what was missing I was told my delivery was damaged. I asked the advisor why I wasn’t informed and they couldn’t tell me. I asked for the majority of the delivery to be refunded and for one single item to be resent. She promised she would do this. 

I received the refund but 4 days later I still had no notification of my redelivery. I spent a further 30 minutes on chat to ASOS and after further inquisition about what was missing was told that they can’t do a refund and reorder at the same time so the item wasn’t reordered for me. 

Exasperated, I asked to raise a complaint. The advisor gave me the link for the help page and only agreed to log it when I asked why he couldn’t just do it. I asked what the process was for investigating and resolving the complaint to which he replied “there is no process, I’ve taken the complaint”. 

He then advised that I would get an email with 72 hours to advise my item was on its way, it’s out of stock so I won’t hold my breath.

Proceed to check out and notice that if I add 8 euros extra, I get free shipping. So I add 4 little things and it's done.

Now, today, the 6th of December, a damn week later, I get an email saying ""oops, actually we don't have the ones we said we did have, here is the money you paid for them"".

So now I get back the money paid for the shoes, but now I wasted Black Friday trusting this company, will have to buy the same shoes at a more expensive price because they can't manage their stock and I now I still paid for 4 other products that I would not have bought if not for the shoes. Ridiculous.

At least ask if I want to wait until they get back in stock or if i want to cancel my entire order, not just nitpick your mistakes away and the client harmed in the process.

Terrible decision making behind this.",1,ASOS,1

I erroneously entered the wrong delivery address and seeked their help in finding a resolution. I was quickly told that there are no options to resolve same and I would have to hope that the recipients rejected the package.

This is unacceptable customer service for me. What if Asos made the mistake wouldnt they have to find a resolution? I expect more assistance from a company I have spent so much money with over so many years. It was my mistake, however there must be some assistance that could be provided for a customer who is at risk of losing their package.

I tried to cancel within seconds of receiving the confirmation email but the system did not allow for cancellation. Then when I tried to get online help for someone to remove the extra items and at least issue me a credit so I could purchase something else (they claimed cancellation was impossible) they refused. Seems I will have to endure paying for duplicate items that I never intended to order. They know most won't bother sending them back as the international shipping cost at your own expense just adds to your losses.

Damob,2019-12-10T22:15:04Z,Used to be fantastic! Massively gone downhill...,"I always used to shop at ASOS - Infact, I have probable spent thousands of pounds with them in the past. Not just because I thought they had well priced clothes, but also because the customer service used to be fantastic. Any issue used to be dealt with with the customers best interest at heart, they were loyal to their customers, and in return customers were generally loyal back.

Lately, I have had a few issues, and all of them have been dealt with appallingly.

1. I ordered a jumper which took around 3 weeks to come. This was only after I made endless phone calls to DPD, ASOS customer service, along with messages on their Facebook messenger. They told me that they needed to wait 5 working days for DPD to respond. Another wasted week. Eventually the jumper came, but I wonder if it would have ever showed up had I not spent realistically over an hour of my life making calls and sending messages.

2. The same jumper was too big, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement. Again, I heard nothing for about 2 weeks, so yet again I got in touch with ASOS customer services. Arbz basically told me that the issue was no longer their responsibility and they were not sending out another jumper, as they haven’t received mine.

Unfortunately, I stupidly mis placed my proof of postage, so am unable to prove that I actually sent it back. My word is simply not good enough after many years of being a loyal customer and several thousands of pounds later.

3. Why are ASOS no longer rewarding their loyal customers? I understand that they are in a bad place financially (high turnovers, low profits/non-existent profits), and will likely need a bail out in the foreseeable future. However, cutting money by offering poor customer service = bad retention, and ultimately means less turnover. 

Come on ASOS! How about you remember how to properly look after your customers and begin to focus on what really matters to your business again!",1,ASOS,1

Anton Covali,2019-12-06T18:21:06Z,"Read this through and you will be ""impressed""","Read this through and you will be “impressed” how Asos works. 

I placed a big order during Black Friday sales. The order was worth 1000 euro and had in total around 55 items. Due to the fact, that you can apply promotions only with orders less than 500 pounds/euros – I had to divide it into 2 parcels, therefore I received 2 confirmations and 2 tracking references for both packages. 
I was e-mailed regarding delivery date, and was patiently waiting for the order. 
On the actual delivery date (it was Friday), I received an e-mail that 1 out of 2 packages was not delivered due to the fact that address was UNDEFINED (I received many other packages from other couriers and never had an issue), where second parcel was still on delivery way and should be expected on Monday. I started contacting Asos – they said there is nothing they can do, Asos transferred this package to delivery company and have no responsibility for it, and according to tracking information from delivery company package is going to be returned back to Asos distributor centre.  Of course I got upset, its Holiday time, Black Friday sales and presents for family. I asked them what we can do about this situation, and if it’s possible for Asos to re-send this package to me again. They said that according to their policies, that are not allowed to re-send the orders, and all they can do is provide a refund. Basically, they said that I should expect money back on my account within 14 business days, meanwhile I can add all the items to the cart again and place a new identical order – this is the only solution they provided. I said okay, I understand everything might happen in this life and let’s move forward. 

When I started placing new order, I realized that 20 out of 25 items that were in my order are currently OUT OF STOCK, because everything was sold out during black Friday. That was a big problem, since there were many specific items that I really needed. I also took in account, that Black Friday had 25% discount on all items, where I didn’t have that privilege anymore. Logically, I asked for the Asos representative on the phone, to at least generate a new discount code for me as it was available during black Friday. After all the frustration, I still wanted to understand their part and go forward with it. All I asked is to “put me in the same shoes” as I was when placing the order which was not delivered – this is the only fair solution. Please take in mind, if Asos provides 25% discount code, I STILL CANNOT BUY ALL DESIRED ITEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY OUT OF STOCK. Eventually, my shopping experience went fully in a wrong way. Eventually, Asos representative said that there IS NOTHING AT ALL THEY CAN HELP ME WITH. ZERO HELP WAS POVIDED. They were not willing to provide any sort of compensation…. I also explained them that I am leaving the country for Holidays, and really need my orders according to delivery date, but again there is nothing they can do…. I truly did not see any human being cooperation..

Getting back to the second parcel – first parcel was not delivered and send back to Asos (on Friday), where second parcel eventually successfully arrived on Monday!!!! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??? 
Just to clarify. Both parcels were ordered at the same address. One parcel doesn’t get to the destination point and reason was: ADDRESS UNDEFINED, where second parcel successfully arrived 2 days after?????!!!! 
Where is the logic???? None of the parcels should of been delivered in this case. There you can clearly understand that it was an issue with delivery company or specifically delivery person, who simply couldn’t find the address in one day, and eventually found it 2 days later…..
After receiving second parcel on Monday, I called Asos immediately to clarify how is that possible. They said they are also very impressed that this happened, and it makes no sense how first parcel was not delivered but second got the point. Eventually, they could see that its totally not my fault and it creates a big issues for me as a customer. Therefore, I asked them again what we can do about first parcel that was not delivered, since I really needed those items. Their answer was not different: there is nothing we can do – please place a new order. I asked them straight forward: 

1. What about 25% discount that was available during black Friday? I don’t have that option anymore.
2. And what about all the items that I purchased and are in stock anymore? 
Answer was typical: nothing we can do – we apologize for inconvenience. 
In my opinion you have more than enough power to make your customer happy and satisfied. Desire is another question. Eventually, I decided to let it go. I lost too many nerves in last couple days having all this discussions with Asos, meanwhile zero help was received. 

I just decided to let it go…. I’m a fighter type of person, but I realized if they are not willing to help after all my tries and effort – than I cannot make them help me. I still needed my clothing items, so I went online, chose new items (since items that I ordered before were out of stock..) and proceeded with the order. Before making the payment, I decided to call Asos again to ask regarding Premium Delivery. (Reminder: I have to go abroad for holiday and have time limitations, therefore I cannot wait for another 2 weeks for standard delivery, and had to use Express delivery). 
My question was next: If I am physically located in the Netherlands, but I use Asos UK region for shopping, would Premium Subscription work in this case? Asos representative who was speaking with me on the phone, asked to hold for a minute while he can discuss it with his team, when he got back he assured me for 100% that I can purchase Premium Subscription in Netherlands and use any store region from Europe to make a purchase. All European countries work in chain, and it doesn’t matter from which region you order – it will be delivered within 2 working days by Premium Delivery. I said thank you and proceeded with the order. Eventually, when I received an order confirmation it said delivery should be expected by December 20, which is 2 weeks/not 2 days - after order was placed…….. I called Asos again… Every time you call them – you speak with different person of course. What you think they said? No sorry, if you are from Netherlands you can only use Premium Delivery for Netherlands Region…. HOW THE HELL is your staff so UNPROFESSIONAL AND SO UNEDUCATED? They provide fake information to customers, who suffer from it.. Instead of helping me out with my issue, they put me in even worst situation. 
Eventually, I decided to never come back to Asos anymore and spread the word about this situation to others. I am waiting for my new placed orders to arrive and I will forget about Asos as a bad dream. This is the worst shopping experience in my life. I lost five days contacting Asos daily through the phone and online chat, spoke with 20-25 different representatives, where none of them provided needed help, but oppositely were providing disinformation and being rude.

Couple more things from my conversations with Asos team, which “killed me” : 
1. If you go to Asos.nl which is Netherlands region website, under support page they do not have CHAT option available at all. It’s simply disabled for Netherlands. I had to go to UK region, where eventually my order was placed, in order to communicate through CHAT. Ten out of twenty times, Asos representatives were not even willing to cooperate with me, and their reason was: 
Sorry, you are from Netherlands region, and you speak with Asos UK. We are going to transfer you to NL team where they can help you out. EVENTUALLY THEY SIMPLY CLOSE THE CHAT. There is not transfer. Employees are not even aware that NL region doesn’t have CHAT OPTION. WHO ARE THEY GOING TO TRANSFER ME TOO????? That is crazy and fully unprofessional…. They simply hang up on you and say we are going to transfer you, where nothing eventually happens and you sit and wait there like an id1ot..
2. Staff is very uneducated. They tell you things which they have no clue about. PREMIUM DELIVERY information was fully wrong. Information was fake and manipulated me to do the wrong moves, where I have to suffer again. One employee says one things, another employee says completely another thing.
3. Besides contacting Asos through Online Chat and Phone, I sent them 2 emails, where response should be received within max 48 hours. None of my emails were answered, its been a week. 

P.S. I am a good person, but I truly hate you for your service and the way you deal with customers. I will do my best letting people know what kind of service you provide especially during HOLIDAYS.",1,ASOS,1

Delivery is SHAMBLES! I ordered 9 items using my next day delivery on Wednesday 4th December at 7am. The items did not come the next day (Thursday 5th December).
3 of my 9 items then arrived on Friday 6th December at 4:50pm. I called Asos customer services who said they would get the other items sent out to me and they would be with my by Sunday 8th December at the latest (she even said on the phone they could come on Saturday 7th December! but more likely Sunday). I asked the lady to change the delivery address to my home address as it was currently set to be sent to my work address which I am at on Monday to Friday. 
I then received an email today at 3am to say 3 of the 6 remaining items would be with me on Monday 9th December. The other 3 items are now out of stock (they weren’t when I ordered them!).
I called Asos customer services again to ask why they are coming to me on Monday 9th December as I was told on the phone they would come today.
The lady then tells me the 3 items in stock will be with you on Tuesday 10th December, not Monday 9th December like the email says!

I cannot believe this. You should be embarrassed.

Sabrina ,2019-12-02T13:12:38Z,"ASOS - No regard for peoples time, money or environment","ASOS is not able to fulfil their orders in the time frame stated! I placed an order on Friday and even though I have next day delivery it said the estimated delivery date would be the 4th of December. I got an email saying they where extremely busy and I would receive an email confirmation in a few hours. When I received the confirmation approx 8 hours later the delivery address was pushed to the 11th of December. I immediately tried to cancel but I was unable to as it was outside the hour period. I needed to cancel or amend the address as I am moving to France on the 5th of December.

I have been told that I cannot cancel or amend the address even though it’s not being dispatched for 10 days. And it’s an error on their end as they are not fulfilling the orders in the time they stated. What Asos have suggested is no 1 that I illegally access the property I am vacating - even though I have said on a number of occasions that I will be in a different country.

The 2nd suggestion which disgusts me is that they are willing to let the order me packaged. Then sent to a currier for delivery - once the currier attempts a number of times it will then be returned to Asos. If the order is returned to Asos they will then process a refund. I am disgusted at how much of a waste of time and money this is. Not to mention the affect this will have on the environment if this is their solution to this issue. 

It is also a waste of my money and they have no regard that the order may go missing.

I will be boycotting Asos until they find a way to be more sustainable. Or show come care towards their workers and they environment. Absolute disgrace!",1,ASOS,1

They are useless, gestion is terrible, they don't reply. Everything is made to build frustration. They send you copy/past that are not relevant. 
It's an international company, well known and having funds but they can't even put a bit of money on customer care issues, RIDICULOUS. 



WORSTE EVER 




If you want the full story:


My order has been placed to be sent in the evening, the courier never came. In the email I've received it's stating they attempt 2 delivery before sending the parcel back to the sender; Tracker not updated for 3 days (I've paid £8 for a next day delivery) and here is the nightmare of the customer care beginning:

You can't call the service so you get this choices:

-  messenger text with automatised reply - useless and no one will reply don't waist your time
- email - no reply
- text chat 

I've been in contact with 5 different persons through the chats, and it just got worst and worst;

First one is asking me to wait at least one day (so a next day delivery not received and a tracker not update for 3 days is not sufficient), ok then I'll wait!

Second person, is sending me copy/past of random things I already know, I've been trying to explain to her for 20 min that I'm asking for my order to be re-issued and she CLOSE the chat on me and send me an email stating I'll be refunded!

I reply straight away asking to not refund but to re-issue the order (sale order) no reply;

Go back on a chat get no one replying for 15 minutes and then get cut out;

AGAIN on the chat end up with a person telling my order is already in Warehouse (which is not) and they can't do anything. I ask to place a new order with the same price and they refuse without any reason. Get the chat CUT ON ME AGAIN.

On the chat again - what a joke -, same b*llsh*t again!!! Send a screenshot showing they should attempt to deliver twice, the person reply ""your email doesn't show your order"", LOL that's your templates go and ask you marketing team to change this!!! They say my order is at the Warehouse - which is not and I will be refunded in 7 day, but then the opposite it's still in transit and will be refunded once received. 

I'm losing my patience and now only copy past just as they do, over and over again - might takes me a few years before I get someone competent.


Go back on the chat and get some one sending me the same things over and over again.

They don't even read what you asking, they don't even know what they are doing!",1,ASOS,1

Firstly I initially wasn’t aware or even made aware that my order had been cancelled last Thursday !!! After having waited in for the order with no luck I logged in to my account to find it had been cancelled! 
I find it insulting after contacting ASOS that they indicated this was because of my payment as this was NOT anything to do with my payment details as I had since used the saved payment details on their site. I believe it was because ASOS simply can not deal with the demand of customers ordering on the deals you have offered on Black Friday ! And then don’t even bother to let the customer know! 

Secondly, not only were some of the items now out of stock which again, was not my fault as I had correctly ordered them on Thursday, I then find it very disappointing that when having to re-order these items I can not even get them on next day delivery, despite having paid for the premier delivery service! I would not be recommending the premier delivery service to anyone in future and will also happily explain how you have failed in this area and take it further! 
I am very unhappy about this and would like to log a formal complaint with the way in which this order was dealt with. Poor customer service from a big company!

There was nothing he was willing to do to help, and wasn’t even able to explain to me why this mistake has been made.

Basically, after I returned two items, the total amount that I spent dropped below the minimum ($250) required for me to use the promo code. While I understand the reasoning, I'd say that most of the stores would have refunded the amount as credit, but ASOS did not. Not the smartest thing to do when trying to grow clientele. I will highly recommend ASOS to consider giving refunds to customers even after they return items after using the promo codes, as most stores do, especially because customers will only know whether the size was correct after trying them on and I feel that I am being punished for doing so here.",1,ASOS,1

That’s is completely unfair on customer side if things as this wasn’t my fault but an error in their end which I understand things like this can happen but to say that if I want the clothes I will have to pay them at full price and not at the discounted price for what I originally order them at.

Ask to be put through to a manager but there is no one available and it will take 24 - 72 hours for them to get back to me

They took my money upfront....why didn't they wait until December 23rd to do that? I'm so worried they took my money and that's the end of that.",1,ASOS,1

Was told when I contacted ASOS that this couldn’t be dealt with until a week later - why? No explanation given. As a premier customer, I was just told that this happens and that it’s in the terms - so basically, pay your subscription and accept if it goes wrong, as a company, they’ll do little to help.  Once that week was up, I was simply told that they didn’t know where they’d gone and would try and get replacements. Bare in mind, both products are currently on the site as out of stock - something that they weren’t a few days ago which if ASOS had dealt with already, would of been with me.

Lindsay Morrison,2019-11-29T00:07:02Z,inconsistent customer service and slow response times,"I ordered a sweater for my boyfriend to be shipped before his birthday (November 17th).
The status showed as delivered on Nov 16 but he did not receive the package. I called fedex and USPS to initiate an investigation. I spent at least 2 hours before I got a case opened.
I then contacted ASOS and followed all of the required checks for a missing package as per their instructions. They assured me a replacement would be sent out within 72 hours via express mail. Shortly after, I received another message indicating I needed to complete those checks again. Days later I was told a new replacement would be sent and I would receive confirmation with 96 hours despite already giving me a similar response. It’s been 4 days now and I still haven’t received any confirmation email the second time around. This process has been very frustrating and has taken way too long. It’s now November 28 and as far as i can tell, there hasn’t been a replacement sent out. As a customer I really don’t appreciate the inconsistent responses and would just like for this to be resolved.

Raised the query again via their chat service. No adequate answer given apart from a pre-written message stating ""For order number XXXXXXX I can see you were refunded XXX GBP on the X December 2019. Please allow 10 working days for the funds to appear in your account.""
I asked for clarification, and was told that if I wanted the items I would have to re-order (not possible since 90% of the items are now out of stock). Some back and forth with the rep and I was advised ""If you have any further questions please visit our help pages"", the chat was closed as I continued to type.

This has been my worst experience. When I received my package I noticed one of the items bags was ripped. Then I noticed another item was just thrown in the bag. The presentation was poor. On top of this 5 of my items were missing. 

When I reached out for customer service I noticed that they were very difficult to contact. I only got through to someone once I tried to send an email. Then once I did I did not receive any explanation for why my items were missing nor was I reassured that they would be sent to me as soon as possible given that I had ordered them with one-day shipping applied. I had to ask the representative if they would be shipped in one day. At this time, 4:47pm, about 4 hours since I spoke with the first representative, I still do not have an updated email of when my items will be arriving. Then when I asked the representative if I would be receiving any courtesy credit for my inconvenience the representative basically ended our chat, which was very rude and dismissive. I was shocked to have such feedback from a customer service representative. When I asked to be connected with someone else the representative refused to do so and then abruptly ended our chat. I am also shocked that the customer service representatives of a large clothing retailer are not trained to give any compensation either in store credit, shipping credit, refund on late items, anything at all for customers who they inconvenience.",1,ASOS,1

If items are clearly faulty then it should be easy to have a replacement item sent once the faulty item is returned. Or some sort of partial credit of some sort.

I was advised from my Hermes tracker that there was a problem with my delivery when I phoned Hermes I was advised that ASOS had cancelled my order. Therefore, contacted Redmond and Olivia who both fobbed me off saying that their Hermes Tracker system was advising them that my package would be delivered by 27th Nov!! I even asked both of them to contact Hermes on my behalf to find out what was going on and was advised that they couldn't do it. I once again contacted Hermes and was told that ASOS had requested that the parcel be destroyed. I immediately got in contact again by live chat (you can't speak to anyone by phone!!) and said that I wanted to know their complaints procedure. This time my 4th contact with ASOS I was met by Werner who looked into this properly and told me that yes my package had been destroyed, at last someone believed me!! They immediately apologised and said that they would get my order redelivered, great. Well done Werner.  Werner would get a 5 star service but because this is for ASOS is a whole my rating is 1. I will not be ordering anything through ASOS again and I would advise others to think very carefully as to whether you want the same hassle as me. I think I was very lucky to find Werner to finally resolve my complaint I don't expect others would be so lucky.
So update.. Only part of my order could be reorder as one of the jackets is now out of stock!!

Rachel Teegarden,2019-11-24T00:50:00Z,Disappointing Customer Care Experience,"First of all, I'd like to say that I was really hopeful because I've had pretty good experiences with ASOS customer service in the past, but today was not the case. 
A week and a half ago, I ordered a pair of shoes through ASOS and finally got them today (I recently moved and accidentally had them shipped to the wrong address so I had to wait and pay extra shipping to have them forwarded). When I opened the shoe box, I was a little surprised because the shoes looked too big. When I ordered, I remember seeing something that led me to believe they were already in women's sizes, so I ordered my normal size. But they were men's size, which means the shoes I just got are about 1-2 sizes too big. 
I contacted their customer care in hopes that they would be able to honor the price I previously paid for the shoes. I bought the shoes mostly because I noticed they were on a good sale, and since I bought them, they went up $8 (which after paying $8 unexpectedly to have them forwarded to my current address wasn't something I wanted to do). 
The customer care rep said that because the item I ordered was in men's sizes, they couldn't honor the price. (Earlier, I had gone into my order to see what I looked at that said it was women's size, and the product page isn't even available anymore  - there may be a way to view it on their end, but I couldn't even look to make sure it was in fact my fault). I was told that nobody had the ability to change the price and they didn't have any discount code they could give me. 
So I can either keep the shoes that don't fit me, not have the shoes I want, or pay more money for a new pair. 
Honestly really disappointed in their customer care and the way the situation was handled.",1,ASOS,1

I bought an order that equated to almost £200 for a prestigious event. The items arrived. Despite using their ‘fitting assistant’ the trousers wouldn’t even go round a child’s leg, and the jacket which was £100 on its own had loose thread every where and bits missing. 

I filled out the form for an exchange and posted it first thing the next morning. 
I contacted customer service to enquire how long it would be till I got my replacement order and they said it would take up to SEVEN WORKING DAYS to even receive my order let alone to when I’d get a replacement of my order. 

I informed them that this was pretty urgent and I needed a replacement and I’d already sent the item back for exchange. They told me I should have sent back for a refund and that if I needed it urgently then I would have to REPEAT my order to the tune of another £200!!! By this point I’d be almost £400 down, with potentially two suits on their way back, and all before Xmas. 

The worst bit was they ended this whole condescending exchange with a smiling emoji after suggesting I should fork out more money.

Sarah Ford,2019-11-22T09:20:17Z,If I could score less than 1* I would...,"Placed an order on Saturday to the value of £265, order accepted and provided with a delivery date of Wednesday. 

By 5pm on Wednesday afternoon, no sign of the order. Contacted customer service on the first occasion to be told by ‘Francesca’ that she could ASSURE me that my order would be delivered by the end of the day despite me not receiving an order update or tracking number. When I questioned the points made by ‘Francesca’ she cut off the chat. 

As predicted, since I hadn’t heard from the local courier, the order did not arrive. 

Contacted Customer Service online again on Thursday AM, to be informed that they could not provide a further update, no information was available. When I asked to speak to a Manager, ‘Rosie’ informed me that I could not speak to a manager or a more senior member of staff to escalate my concerns as they ‘don’t have managers’. Also informed that I could not obtain a refund, despite the company not fulfilling the order on time. 

Not satisfied with this response I contacted Customer Service again, to be informed by ‘Daniella’ that the issue had been passed to a ‘Specialist’ team to look into and that I should receive a response within 24 hours, so I expected when I did receive an email from the ‘Specialist’ team it was just an email to say they were looking into my order. 

All of this contact is made via chat or email, making it difficult to express concerns properly, which left me feeling really quite exasperated, as it is becoming more apparent that no communication about my order is not a concern for the company, as they have the money. It also appears that customers are just treated as a number.  

Contacted Customer Service on Friday for a further update, hopeful that the ‘Specialist’ team may have done something since the 1am email I received saying it was being looked into. 

Was put on a chat with ‘Edward’ who appeared to take great delight in informing me that there was no further update and I should just wait to hear. I asked again about escalating the issue and whether he could try and chase the ‘Specialist’ team and he said that wasn’t possible. They would be dealing with other queries and that he couldn’t give me a timescale as to when I could expect to have an update. 

It’s become really apparent that customer service is not a priority for ASOS as a whole. The advisors are not willing to help and seem so blase, avoiding answering questions and continually fobbing you off with a clearly generic response. Being spoken to in a more considerate manner would go someway to help even if it is to simply placate you until the issue is resolved. At no point have I received an apology and the way in which I have been spoken to is abysmal.

I appreciate that there can be delays with deliveries and would be more accepting of this if I had some information to go on but it doesn’t fill me with much confidence that I am still awaiting contact and delivery and the status of my order.",1,ASOS,1

After sending emails back and forth for over a week I was sent on to a “specialist team” to deal with the issue who sent me an email the day after saying I’d been added to the premier delivery spreadsheet and would have it on my account within a few days. I then got an email saying premier delivery was added to my account and I was good to go. I have just tried to order and yet again premier delivery isn’t on my account. After searching google I finally found the customer service number, which they hide quite well, and was told to restart the emailing proof of purchase for premier delivery and then I would be sent over to the “specialist team” to be added to the spreadsheet again. For a company of this size and for the amount of people who buy premier delivery this shouldn’t be an issue and everyone I’ve spoken to doesn’t seem to care in the slightest and just wants me to email proof of purchase and start the same 2 week process I’ve already been through.

I’ve had parcels come damaged and after being told I’ve got a replacement sent I’ve had to chase it up a week later because I’ve received no replacement. My most recent issue with asos is their ridiculous policy on items returned to them by their carriers. So this month November 2019 I made a large order with asos (which I tend to do monthly) after waiting for the delivery which was going to take over a week to get here I waited patiently. However, when tracking my parcel on the Hermes website to see when my parcel arrived it had “parcel returned to sender” it did not explain why, I revived no email or text to inform me on this. After getting in touch with asos I finally found out that my parcel was returned because it was damaged. But asos explained that they couldn’t resend my parcel straight away and I’d have to wait up to 10 days for my refund and then process the order again for ‘security reasons’.

I had to talk to two separate people, and both tried to tell me that it had been delivered already, while I continually insisted it was not even possible. where I live, deliveries do not take place on Sunday's - which is when they were insisting it was delivered - at 5 in the morning even though the tracking stopped in the major city in my state, and never reached me.The incompetence of the customer service team was made evident even more, when after eventually being referred to a specialist team to investigate the issue, they emailed me informing me that they had refunded the amount of my order. Apart from the shipping. This meant I had to take more time to email them a very lengthy email about how ASOS had failed to deliver my order, and how I was unsure how them failing to do this meant I should still be paying a ridiculous amount of money for delivery. After this hassle, of course it would be reasonable to expect to be offered a coupon code etc to purchase the items at the same price as during the sale, but this is ASOS we're talking about, who have the most patronising and frustrating customer service I have ever encountered. I cannot stress enough how frustrating it is to order something for a specific date and not receive it not once, but twice. My recent order was for a wedding, where I had once again, attempted to order the shoes for this event, and received it three days too late.Can not recommend enough to not order anything late notice relying on what their delivery times are.",1,ASOS,1

They have just requested to replace my order and told me to wait 24hours for a confirmation email. (no more information/options to compensate any inconveniences that his has might caused)
I am disappointed as nobody has contacted me to inform me about any issues with my order. Also, Customer service has not given me any options to write a formal complaint/other actions I could take. I actually found them really rude as they kept saying 'as advised' over and over again like I was making questions that they had already replied before. Then they have closed the chat...

Vee Jay,2019-11-19T17:31:45Z,Awful,"The worst delivery record of any online retailer. You have to fight with them to get an explanation about missing deliveries.

If a courier misplaces your item then you are out of pocket, with no explanation until it finds it way back to them, which could take weeks. All ASOS can say is “it’s not our fault.” They have lied to me, ignored me... just the worst customer service for such a big company.",1,ASOS,1

On top of that the solution for diverting a delivery is absolutely ridiculous for a company that considers itself as a world class online e-commerce.

I am absolutely shocked that my delivery which will be accidentally delivered to wrong address can not be refunded (because of a human error!!!) or at least reshipped to my correct address.

I asked for a refund as they had not delivered on their promise of a replacement and they then said I would be in a queue for that which could take days (I was fuming at this point).

I am mortified with the service I have received both on your live chat and customer service line. I spoke to two people who were unwilling to help and rude. If you refer to the phone call around 13:00 today made regarding my order you will understand my upset and frustration.

The customer service rep didn’t listen to me at all, didn’t give me steps to resolve the issue, didn’t care that I would be shoeless for my event and had a disgusting attitude. This is the worst service I have ever received, as someone who orders weekly from ASOS I do not expect this level of service. 

The lady on the live chat just sent me automated messages and then closed the chat. This is the most disgusting service I have every received and I will never order from ASOS again.

After talking with a few other people I found out that I am actually not the only one this happened to. Recently I placed an order for a few items during a promotion. (If you spent over 130 you get 30 off) I spent a total of around 155 so I was eligible for the coupon. When my items arrived one of the shirts was folded inside out, had a ripped tag and stains all over the front of it. I immediately filled out the return label and sent it back. When ASOS received my item they told me they would only refund me 70 cents back. yes 70 cents... They told me that since I sent a shirt back, my spending mark was now only 129 (not 130) and therefore no longer eligible for the 30 off discount. So long story short, ASOS tells customers they are eligible for coupon codes when they spend over a certain amount. Then they send out damaged items. When you send back the damaged item, they keep the item and then take your original coupon away. This is totally fraudelent. A really bad people situation for people who are college students like myself and dont have the extra money to spare. Hope this helps, avoid ASOS if you can!",1,ASOS,1

I spent £200 on a order on next day evening delivery for it not to turn up. I got in contact with ‘city sprint’ which i had never had as a courier before. They were rude on the phone and would not talk to me and said i had to go through asos to follow up my order. I went on asos live chat and was told it was due to floods, which i was calm about but knew i was getting fobbed off as they were able to go round but they refused to. after two tries to delivery, on the third day i knew the road was back open so there was no doubt in my mind that it would get delivered that day. Never heard anything from the delivery company in terms of tracking, delivery update or email to say it was on its way unlike the days before. 4 days went by before i got in contact with asos again to ask for them to get in contact with the company to follow up and where my order was, to then find out they had actually lost my delivery on the first day and never intended on telling me. i was furious but needed to stuff on my order so ordered again but went for next day delivery instead of evening, hoping for it to be hermes or DPD as i have never had problems with these company's. It was meant to be delivered on the 14th and it is now the 21st. This is threw hermes and on the 14th i was given a tracking code which assured me on the app that it was going to be delivered between 3-5pm that day. I had waited in ALL DAY downstairs to make sure i would not miss the knock on the door for it to never turn up. That night i went onto the live chat once again to explain how furious i was for a rude ‘Thomas’ to pie me off and tell me its out of there hands and i had to wait till the 20th to get back in contact before exiting the chat. I have tried getting in contact with asos last night and today, and keeping getting put in a chat with ‘Anastasia’ who wont reply back in the chat -.- on email they will not respond back to me and are taking no responsibility for the matter. Id try normal 3-5 day delivery but il just assume there just not going to deliver anything to me. What is the point letting me order if I'm never going to receive my order and you just keeping having to give my money back?

2) it will take over 3 weeks (17 business days) for them to process it - which is unreasonable 
3) if the parcel i send back (by their return service) is lost, I am responsible for the loss of parcel!!

Olivia,2019-11-22T16:56:41Z,HORRIBLE Customer Service,"Absolutely horrendous experience with everyone involved in this company. They refuse to take blame for their mistakes or offer any kind of help to fix their mistakes. I ordered a jacket from this site and the photo was in mid wash, the color was in mid wash, AND under product details it said ""mid wash finish"". the product name however, was ASOS jacket in light wash. Obviously VERY confusing, but THREE separate places were telling me mid wash. Of course, it comes in and it's light wash. I tried speaking to their customer service and the first time she told me ""This was not a maufacturing error, this was a user error and we change the fact that you ordered the wrong item"" !! Again, I understand that the product name had light wash in it, but the product details, photo, and color option were ALL mid wash!! This was not user error, this was an error on the part of the company. Immediately after I received that message she closed the conversation so I could no longer respond. So, I tried contacting them again, really all I wanted was to swap this jacket for a mid wash one. Well, this one also tells me it's my fault and shows me the correct item I should have ordered for mid wash. Except this one is $35 and my original one I ordered was only $25! And, my original was placed in part of a bigger order in which I received free shipping. So I originally paid $25 and free shipping, and now they're telling me it's my fault and to fix it I have to pay $35 PLUS shipping! BUT to make it worse, I already found the ""mid wash variant"" on their website (exact same product name and colors and everything) BUT FOR $28.50. So not only are they telling me that in order to get the one I want, I'll have to just repurchase a more expensive listing, but they are giving me a MORE expensive listing than their website even shows!! They absolutely refused to do an exchange, price match, give me a free shipping code, etc, anything at all. Just kept repeating this is my fault for ordering the wrong item (which I stand by that I did NOT. they listed the wrong item)",1,ASOS,1

With a Asos  I always seem to find the statement piece,  accessory or fashion staple either at a great price our within reason.  There have been times that the price didn't even matter,  i had to have it.  However Customer service,  despite being extremely pleasant is SORELY DISAPPOINTING. I regularly wreck my budget for an items on Asos, i'm on the site daily. I utilize 2 day shipping and through experience ive learned to keep in mind that it may very well be longer,  thankfully  not regularly and now they try to give you a heads up when they're super busy.  So hey it's still a great deal..HOWEVER if you by chance receive a faulty item ...YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK IN A BIG WAY! Of course you may return it and receive a refund or credit depending on when you get it back tt them. BUT if you can't afford to repurchase it at that time or before it goes OUT OF STOCK... OH WELL,  you have no recourse.  NO. They won't hold a replacement for you until they receive your return...NO. They wont send a replacement and wait for their return. NO. They don't give you an OOPS WE GOOFED discount of  your next purchase..YOU may return your item within 45 days for a refund...i guess i should be grateful but i don't.  I mean they're in the fashion business right so they must know that people's emotions are attached to these purchases ...at least mine are. In fact I know they do because each back in stock notification I receive from them starts with GO...GO...GO. besides,  i communicated how  i felt. 
Admittedly I got over it and continued shopping as I'm guessing they knew I would. But each time it's the same response and THATS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE .IN GOOD FAITH I sent you money for an item I expected to receive. You sent me previously worn damaged merchandise.

Many of us would have benefited from not receiving that email at all and continued to return within 28 days for a full refund rather than thinking we had 45 days for a refund. Now my order 437626*** will not receive the refund I was looking for. I may never use that voucher. I’ve never returned an item outside of the return window until now because I was confused and thought ASOS had lengthened it. Very disappointed.,1,ASOS,1

Never get in touch with them, you'll never get into a solution, rude to customers.

I placed an order for next day delivery on the 14th October 2019, and it still has not arrived on 21st October. When I tried to get in touch using their ‘chat’ service, the agents fob me off and say it is “delayed”. No more information than that. I have had numerous issues with ASOS lately, including items missing from my orders, wrong items arriving, placing orders that are then cancelled by ASOS because the item is out of stock, (why take my order then?) parcels delayed, delivered to the wrong address, damaged items arriving etc. I used to love shopping with ASOS but they have gone seriously downhill lately, too many mistakes and cock-ups and it’s becoming a pattern.

I knew that ASOS did free returns so I decided to send it back for a refund in hopes to order something new. I requested for a refund... and then never got sent the sheet that’s supposed to go in my package. I reached out to customer support. This took almost an hour to load. I was quite mad by this point. Finally I got to return my package. 2 weeks later. Still hadn’t heard anything from ASOS. Decided to contact them. The contact me page wouldn’t load AT ALL. I logged into messenger instead. The reply time was awful but FINALLY got a response. She told me she’d look into why I hadn’t got my refund and I’d hear something within 24 hours. It’s been two days and still nothing. I basically paid 90 dollars to try on a skirt. Not happy at all. 

At the same time I sent in my package for the skirt I also sent in a return from the iconic and the shirt was too small for my partner. I was contacted instantly and was sent a refund within 7 days. This was much better service.",1,ASOS,1

Constance Renada,2019-10-12T08:52:32Z,A Wild. Fricking. Goose. Chase.,"On my life, if I could give 0 stars I would, but TrustPilot won't let me.

3 separate times I have tried to order from Asos, and on all 3 occasions, they have failed to meet the minimum standards for customer service.
I ordered 2 dresses for a wedding, both of which I ordered at the same time. I paid for next day delivery, but for some reason, the delivery was held with the couriers and I could not get a single answer as to why that was. I ordered the dresses on Thursday to try them on and see which one was better..The dresses arrived the following Monday, which was pointless seeing as the Wedding was on Saturday, and has already passed! After almost a week of arguing with their ""Customer Care"" team, they finally agreed to refund the delivery fees. I guess they redeemed themselves at the last minute.

The second time, they had send me emails about offers they were having, so I took a chance on them and decided to order a jump-suit for the Summer. Again... I paid for next day delivery (which to be fair, I should just stop paying because its never really going to arrive on the same day). It turned up a day late, which I guess isn't as bad but I was not pleased. I kid you not when I say I opened the packaging and inside was a size 20 dress that had what looked like the Botanical Gardens spewed all over it. I ordered a light pink jumpsuit in a size 14 and this is what I got. Some of you might think i'm exaggerating, I promise you I have screenshots of my order and photos of what I received. Again.. had to send it back and ask for a full refund because they didn't actually have the jumpsuit I wanted in stock.
I guess thats what they do? Just send any random item in place of what a customer has actually ordered. 

This third time, I ordered a specific winter jacket, to be fair it wasn't for me. It was a gift for someone who had been trying to find something in that style and unfortunately, Asos seemed to be the ONLY site online anywhere that did this kind of style. I sucked it up and just went ahead with it, only to be sent on some crazy wild goose chase. AGAIN.. I paid for next day delivery (seriously.. I'm just never going to bother with NDD again. You'd think I would have learned!)
I wake up to a text message saying that my order will be delivered between the hours of 9:00am and 10:00am.. and literally a few minutes later, they send me another message saying that the delivery has been delayed and they'll try and deliver another time in the week. 
Excuse me? Another time in the week? At this point, I was just speechless..
I called the ""Customer Care"" team, and the guy on the phone said there was literally nothing he could do. He kinda sounded like he was new? So I wasn't going to go crazy at him for something I could not blame him for directly.. wouldn't be fair. But seriously.. I tried to contact the couriers and apparently they don't have call services if you order through another company. Ha okay.
I spent time on the phone calling another department, speaking to other members of their team and lastly was just told that there simply is nothing they can do. 
This is supposed to be a gift Im going to give to someone, that I'm supposed to take with me on a flight that is leaving today... the day on which it is supposed to arrive. Now I dont care about the whole ""you should have ordered ahead of time to avoid this situation"".. what the hell is next day delivery for then mate? Goodness sake..

So, now I'm writing this in the car on my way to the airport.. and after all that conundrum.. spending hours on the phone, trying to sort out another delivery location which isn't easy especially if the couriers do not answer and with Asos not wanting to assist you any further... I open the door to leave for the Airport to catch my flight (which im running late for because I had to try and fix their mistake.. Thanks Asos) I open the door.. and behold.. a Hermes Delivery driver with my order.

Georgie Wilks,2019-10-12T08:36:22Z,if I could give less that 1 star I would,"The service from agent#1 I received did not answer any of the questions I had. I said the problem was that Hermes had ‘attempted‘ to deliver my parcel twice when I was in the building and had just left without attempting to contact me. Therefore, if they tried to deliver tomorrow with me there, there still wouldn’t be a change and I wouldn’t get my parcel. I found this unacceptable and also wanted to the parcel company to call me when they couldn’t get into the building so I could get my parcel. All I got were canned answers saying they would deliver next day, repeating the same thing again and again and outright ignoring the issue I was outlining. When I then tried to talk to someone else because this agent clearly didn’t understand my problem, I was told I wasn’t allowed to. I then said I wanted the order cancelled and refunded as I clearly wasn’t receiving the items and was told I couldn’t do this either. I then asked where I could complain to and was told only to the agent. There were no apologies, no understanding and it was clear the agent did not want to do anything to help. This was after talking to an agent#2 earlier who I also described the situation to and he said he couldn’t investigate until the end of the day even though I sent them a screenshot of the information I got from Hermes saying they won’t deliver until the next day because they attempted delivery again. Therefore I still wouldn’t be able to get Hermes to call me before delivery and was destined to again, get an ‘attempted’ delivery. I was typing my reply to this and got told that they had given me all the advice they knew and closed the chat before I could reply.

Fanny Bostinius,2019-10-15T12:42:22Z,Horrible customer service and bad stock management,"I am sorry, but I can only provide 1 star. I am very disappointed and hurt - because ASOS used to be a dear friend of mine, but now you really hurt my feelings. Get better please, or I will find someone else. 

Placed an order which was supposed to arrive on oct 4. I received an email one day after ordering stating that the order had been delayed one day. This was mid week before the weekend. On Oct 8 I still hadn't received anything and the order had not been shipped yet according to my profile. So I contacted ASOS. Only then did I receive notice that my order for no apparent reason had been unsuccessful but I had not been charged with any money(which I had) and the items were still in stock (which they weren't) so I could just go ahead and replace the order. I did so, having to spend more money, because the items that I needed the most, was no longer in stock. After this, I received the money back for the first attempt to order, however (due to exchange rates I guess) I lost around 10GBP on this. Furthermore this also meant that the items that I had ordered in the second attempt I still haven't received as they had even longer delivery time compared to the first attempt. I have been in touch with ASOS customer care about this, and their attitude is really disappointing. We went back and forth about compensation for example in the shape of a complementary express shipment after the failed first attempt - that was not possible due to the fact that I had not had any costs from this failed order and they had informed me of the order being unsuccessful. But this was both untrue, which I made clear. I also made clear that I was dissatisfied. Ultimately I received the cool and short conclusion: ""I'm very sorry for the convenience(yes, CONVENIENCE). Unfortunately we don't offer compensation to our customers""..... OMG!!!!

I have never had any complaints to ASOS for all the years that I have been shopping there. But these past few months it gets worse and worse. More often than not items that seem in stock are not in stock, which you won't get notified of until after you have placed and paid for you order. And via e-mail. So if you need a jacket amongst other things and it turns our it was out of stock after the order was placed and paid for, you have to go and make a new order with another jacket - this is both frustrating and straight up stupid. Get your stock management in check - this never used to be a problem!!",1,ASOS,1

Ashley,2019-09-11T17:08:10Z,"Useless customer service, I'll never bother with ASOS again","Absolutely useless customer service. I LOVE their clothes and had plans on spending quite a bit of money on their website for my autumn/winter wardrobe but I'll literally never bother again. 

I've been going in circles between ASOS and MyHermes all morning and no one will give me any answer to the simple question of 'how do I give my entry code to my flat to the MyHermes delivery driver'. 

MyHermes claimed to have attempted delivery to my flat yesterday but I was home and no one ever buzzed up. Now they're trying to deliver again today but I'm at work. So all I want to do is give my entry code so the parcel can be left at my door (no signature is required). That sounds simple right? This is how Amazon functions. But no one at MyHermes will talk to me because I have an ASOS tracking number, but no one at ASOS will give me any answer as to how I can contact MyHermes to give my entry code. ASOS live chat reps kept sending me back to MyHermes who wont talk to me. The first rep Chelsea gave me a phone number to MyHermes that was literally just a recorded message telling me to check the MyHermes website FAQ or contact them through their contact form (but I can't! It won't accept my tracking number because its from ASOS!). The second ASOS rep Alex was just rude. He ended the chat while I was still typing and dodged all of my questions and kept telling me to contact MyHermes. They literally do not care about their customers. I'm glad this happened with a single item package and I never bothered wasting more money on them.

Who knows if I'll ever get this dress at this point. But goodbye forever, ASOS. Your clothes are amazing but it isn't worth this headache.",1,ASOS,1

I had a blazer on notification to alert me as soon as it was back in stock. I ordered the blazer next day delivery which didn’t arrive. I checked tracking and it advised there was a delay and to expect it 24/48 hours later. I patiently waited for 8 days to out of the blue receive a refund having never received or returned the item, which was now out of stock. I then complained to be told I could use the notification button. I replied to say I already had which is why I ordered it in the first place and why was I refunded without even receiving the item. I was told it had been lost. As I had no update for 8 days I missed out on any opportunity to purchase another as they were now completely sold out. I complained and was told it would be looked into. A few weeks later I returned the same item that I had ordered in a different colour as I didn’t like it. I was not refunded and told that I had already received my refund when I complained before.

Rachel Ahlquist,2019-10-09T16:30:38Z,Apparently the only way to complain,"I generally like ASOS and am a member of their VIP next-day delivery service. I recently ordered my standard foundation on this service, when they had a 25% off offer on. When it arrived, they had sent the wrong shade so I sent it back, requesting a replacement. Before I did this, I checked with online chat that they would be able to just send me the correct one, next day delivery, without charging any extra (the deal had expired). They assured me it was fine. 

When I sent it back, they refunded the purchase instead. By then, it was a week after I ordered the foundation (which I had paid to get next day delivery for!) and I just wanted them to be able to send me the product back again, as it was the same price. The online chat agent said he wasn't able to help and would escalate to a colleague who would get it touch. 

Nearly a week later and I still haven't heard anything. A new online chat agent has told me that was bad advice, and actually I need to reorder the product and then they will issue a 25% refund. 

LUDICROUSLY when I said I wanted to raise the bad advice and delay in getting my product as a complaint about the service, they told me they don't have a complaints department, and the only way to do it is leave a negative review online and then someone will get on touch with me.

Dee D,2019-10-07T01:32:52Z,I have shopped from ASOS for many years…,"I have shopped from ASOS for many years and I always have a few orders that come in and go back. Finding clothes that fit in brick and mortar shops are a little stressful as a size 16/18, so ordering from ASOS has been a fantastic way for me to try out clothes. I often order two sizes of each item and I keep one. Shopping is a very easy going process, returns are a breeze and I never ever had a major issue until today.

ASOS almost always have some discount code so in my last order I used one ($70 off a $250 order) as usual and I partially returned the order after keeping an item. I was surprised that I was refunded the order minus the full price of the item I kept. Turns out, if you use a discount code when you place an order and decide to return some things from that order, the items you keep automatically revert to full price if you fall below ""minimum spend"". This must be a new policy as I bought and returned so many things over the years using these codes and never have i been charged full price because i haven't met ""the minimum spend"". Customer service advised me ""to read ""terms and conditions"" every time i use a discount code"".Ain't nobody got time for that. 

ASOS has made shopping super easy for Australian consumers in the past few years and easy returns are a big part of that. If returning orders are not straightforward anymore, they need to be explicit about this, and I don't mind some fine print about a discount code. I am not going to shop from ASOS after this as I cannot trust the return process.",1,ASOS,1

I attempted checkout with afterpay, however during the confirmation process the website crashed and said that there was a technical issue and the order was not placed. So I immediately ordered the dress and paid using credit card. Later in the evening I logged onto my emails and saw that I had 2 orders for the same Dress. One with credit card and the other with after pay. I contact your help team and was told I should of cancelled my order straight away and that it was too late to now cancel the order. What annoys me is that I did not know I had ordered 2 dresses as your website was faulty and the women I dealt with was not helpful one bit!!! Also, I’ve tried hoping online to do the ‘chat’ and email option but your website keeps asking to log in, and won’t function proberly.",1,ASOS,1
Lizi,2019-10-20T17:28:16Z,Very poor customer service.,"Very poor customer service.
My order didn’t arrive so I contacted customer service (This took 45mins to get through) who said give us 24hrs to investigate. 
Within seconds of the chat ending I got a paypal emailing saying my payment had been refunded. So I waited an hour but no contact from ASOS. Still said my order had been sent.
I recontacted (another 20mins) to say I needed to reordered as they had lost my order. I am now down an extra £360 as I have had to pay double until the 10 working days it takes for my refund to clear.
In addition if I want them to pay to send it next day based on their error then I have to recontact them for a third time (wait for the dispatch email then wait for the chat to connect) to give them my order number. Very unhelpful and robotic response from the customer help line. When I asked to raise a complaint I was told they don’t take complaints!
Won’t be using again - very poor customer service when they have made an error. Complete lack of wanting to correct and ensure I had a good experience with their company",1,ASOS,1

As monday came, delivery was scheduled between 3-5pm and I requested the parcel to be left in a safe place. The delivery attempt was made at 7pm and the delivery courier didnt bother leaving it in a safe place. On tuesday the second delivery attempt was to take place. I got no email, no time scale of when to accept the parcel, nothing. Tuesday had passed and as i tracked the online delivery, it showed mondays update (so they hadnt updated the system). This went on for the whole week and when I spoke to Asos customer care, they were awfully rude. They didnt accept liability, stating sometimes orders can be delayed. But if thats the case why did I have to pay a premium price yet get nothing in return. They then closed the chat and didnt bother wanting to solve anything.

Bianca,2019-10-15T07:35:10Z,Slow delivery... parcel left in stupid place so did not receive it... poor customer response times,"I placed an order expecting it to arrive before my holiday but after 6 days it still had not arrived. I then returned from holiday and found a slip saying the order was in the green bin - however this was emptied by the bin men while we were away so the package and it’s contents were thrown away!

I am very disappointed at the slow delivery of the package and the fact I could not take the items on holiday. I always thought ASOS tried to deliver in 2-3 days? 

I still want the products I have ordered however this means I am going to have to wait even longer for re-delivery. 

I am a regular user of your sight and never usually have these problems. It seems silly to put a parcel inside a bin... why not put it behind etc? 

I have also been stuck waiting trying to live chat on your sight for over an hour with no luck - so instead went through Facebook messenger - although I still have to wait hours between replies!

I ordered a jacket, and when I received it and tried it on, it was HUGE, running at least two sizes too big. All I wanted was an exchange. First of all, they told me that they couldn't exchange it and that I would have to return and then rebuy. Second, they told me that they would deduct the full $20 from the refund because I used a $20 off $100 order code. So they're going to refund me $31 and then want me to rebuy it at $51 instead of working to do an exchange for me. What?! This is horrible customer service! Not only that, but if the $20 item in my shipment hadn't worked out, they would have just kept it without refunding anything?? They need to do a prorated discount on each item like every other retailer when you use a coupon. It's ridiculous and unethical.

Third, it's been a month and I still haven't received my refund. I used the sticker in the bag, filled out the form, and sent it back in the original bag. They told me 10 working days to receive confirmation that they received it, and I haven't received any confirmation at all. They've kept my item but haven't given me any credit back for it! 

First and last time I ever buy from this company. I'll stick with places I can trust, and I can't trust ASOS.",1,ASOS,1

The customer agent who spoke to me was rude. I told her if they aren’t able to find the order please issue a refund. She refused, saying till they have an answer from the courier they wouldn’t be able to do anything. First of all i only chose the clothing company not the courier.

Rebecca Hay,2019-10-16T22:06:14Z,Never been more angry at an order.,"Never been more angry at an order.

This has been the worst online shopping experience. My shoe size is a US size 5.5. I ordered a pair of shoes in the size UK 3, which is supposed to convert over to US 5. I was worried they'd be too small, but they are at least one size too big. They are huge on me and unwearable. They also have several scuff marks on the sides, as if someone has worn them or damaged them somehow.

I paid extra for express shipping because I needed them for a wedding this weekend. They arrived on time but I now don't have enough time to exchange them for something wearable. The shoes themselves were a little over $73 and the shipping was $20. At the door, I had to pay another $40.43 in customs.

I also got a pair of earrings in the same order that came broken. I can't get the backs off them because the pierce part is bent on both of them. Again, unwearable.

In order to get a refund, I have to now pay an ADDITIONAL $22 to ship my order back to ASOS. So that means I'll be able to get just $92.39 back of the $175.23 I spent. I'll be out $82.84 AND I'll have NO SHOES and NO EARRINGS to wear this weekend. Might as well have just thrown my cash into a blender. Would have saved me the disappointment.",1,ASOS,1

Safe to say I declined that offer, which is apparently the ‘best they can do’ as they don’t offer monetary compensation. This whole company seems to be completely deluded.

One week passed and I got in touch with a customer representative through the e-chat and got to know that the order will not be delivered as it was returned and refunded. Why? No answer only general blabla. Why the order status was never updated and it still shows as confirmed? No reply. When I asked the reason, the CR simply ended the chat. Well done ASOS",1,ASOS,1

Can I have a refund of my next day delivery as it was not what I was sold.

Asos have not bothered to acknowledge the inconvenience or offer anything to compensate for this- I was even rejected for a discount code! Even if the fault here lies with the notoriously poor delivery provider that is Hermes, Asos should still take pride in customer service and apologise for any inconvience caused.

That is insane!! Working in customer care myself, this would NEVER be an appropriate way to handle something that had been our mistake.

Isaac,2019-10-19T15:46:00Z,WARNING: ASOS LIES ABOUT PACKAGES FOR WEEKS,"This is my first time ever reviewing anything; I must WARN EVERYBODY:

After exactly 2 weeks of straight-up lies about my parcel being in delivery, three talks with the customer service, they've sent me a mail declaring that the items I have ordered (and were supposedly on their way) are in fact out of stock.

Before this, they refused to send me any updates about the whereabouts of the package, I had to reach out to their amateurish live chat support to find out everything.

The funny thing is that both items are still in stock on their website (and in my size) so even their last mail was a lie.",1,ASOS,1

ASOS was unwilling to allow me to repurchase the proper sizes at the same price, which clearly tells me they do not care whether they lose me as a customer. I'll be returning my items for a refund and am currently working with someone from ASOS to close my account permanently. 

This whole experience has been extremely frustrating. Now that I know my proper size, I was looking forward to many more ASOS purchases. It's truly disappointing that ASOS does not care enough to allow me to repurchase the items I love in the proper size at the price I paid originally.",1,ASOS,1

Today, I had everything refunded, including the trainers. I contacted ASOS through the chat facility on their website about getting the correct size sent out instead of having to buy them again (and losing the 25% discount). The person behind the chat ""Lydia"" didn't even care, just basically said tough, keep an eye out for another discount and buy them again. Not even an apology about misreading the returns note, just came out as quite rude. I have been a customer of ASOS for probably about 10 years and pay for premium delivery. Ok, I am not the biggest buyer, but 90% of the clothes I buy are through ASOS and this just shows how much they actually care. Quite sad really, but I will not be buying from ASOS again..",1,ASOS,1

So yes now I'll need to do some stressful last minute shopping because of that. So yes there are loads of things and a lot of offers but if you actually need something don't use it.,1,ASOS,1

I ordered a pair of backless white faux leather mules in a US size 8. The shoes i received are labelled a size 8 and are easily three sizes too big. They are absolutely not a standard US size 8. I have worn this size my entire adult life and never experienced this issue. 
The ASOS rep i dealt with through the chat was not helpful told me there was nothing he could do. Which means i am now going to have to pay $22.50 in shipping to send back a faulty product that is not at all what was advertised. It is going to cost me, the consumer money to deal with your terrible product.

I ask of the shoes I order where in stock and when will I receive them if I send the incorrect shoes back. Was told that they don't know and if the shoes are not in stock than I will receive an refund. I told the chat rep. That don't want a refund I want the shoes that I ordered. Asked the chat rep. Kate if the shoes were in stock and was told no they were not. So I'm like if I didn't ask you were not going  tell me which means that if I send these shoes back I'll be waiting forever for my shoes or receive my refund in a month from now. I asked to be escalated to high authority and was told that she can not escalate the issue. 

This is unacceptable to not have a customer service line to speak with someone but to also have an only chat line in which they are not giving the customer 100% customer service for issues that were not of there fault but of ASOS.

Amy Turnbull,2019-08-30T19:13:34Z,The worst customer service I have ever experienced,"I am absolutely fuming after my most recent experience with ASOS customer service. After being a frequent customer for a number of years, I had countless issues with my most recent orders. I contacted their customer service on Twitter, on Facebook, on email and on their website via live chat and each time was dismissed, patronised and belittled. None of their advisers seem to have any desire to actually help or resolve any issues. Their first approach to a complaint is to blame the customer which I feel is an absolutely disgraceful way to treat a customer. Once they have your money they do not care. 

After contacting customer service on literally every avenue they offer and being ignored, I returned orders after the 28 day time period. As a disabled person it is not easy for me to get to a store to return the collect + parcels so I therefore waited to be advised by customer services so I didn't have to make multiple journeys to the shop. When it became apparent they were just going to completely ignore me, I sent the parcels back and I am now being refused a refund. 

I have again had to contact them multiple times/ways and have now had 2 of their advisers tell me this situation is my fault, not theirs and that they refuse to help and they have ended the chat, not allowing me to even respond. 

Absolutely vile treatment of their customers. 

I have noticed the quality of ASOS own range/products drastically decline in the last few years and in combination with the appalling customer service, I believe this will be the downfall of the company.",1,ASOS,1

ASOS addressing you directly - are you ever going to resolve your horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE problem? Not only your staff are trained to reply as robots - there is no empathy or remote care. Just because you're a multi-million dollar company, it doesn't mean that you can ignore your customers. Never be too confident in your ability to stay competitive in the online space as there will be other much more capable companies out there who genuinely give a care about what thier customers think and will continue taking away business from you.

Christian Moore,2019-09-23T10:49:03Z,Don't order anything next day,"First shopping experience with Asos has been truly awful. I ordered at 16:00 on Thursday for a Next Day Delivery (cut off of 23:00) for Friday, the next day I checked on the estimated delivery time as nothing had arrived by 17:00. Turned out that they have moved the estimated delivery to suit their own needs. No messaging to me or the site on Thursday about Next Day Delivery delays, but they had added one on Friday, way after I had made my order. I requested to cancel my order and was told it was too late to do so, and was recommended to refuse delivery, which was not an option considering I chose delivery to my work to ensure I could receive the parcel on Friday. Well, I'm not at work on Saturday am I. So after a deluge of emails and text messages about a delivery they could not make and I could not collect, they chose to deliver to a collection point. I have no use for the item after Saturday, which is the entire reason I opted for NEXT DAY delivery. Now I have to go collect the parcel in order to send it back. Imbeciles. Customer service was no help, they had no solution, poor shopping experience, wasted time, wasted money, laughable over-communication about an order which had passed its intended use pretty much 24hrs after ordering.

Unfortunately my opinion on this swiftly changed when I went to order some holiday clothes and other items and discovered my account was blocked. Tweeting ASOS customer care team they promptly tweeted back asking me to DM them some info (which I was very happy about as they came back so quick, so thought this would be resolved soon). I was told that my account had had suspicious activity and I would need to change my password and advise them when I have done so and they would kindly unblock my account. I did so straight away and received a standard automatic message advising they had received my email. The next day I received an email advising the same message, to change my password. I advised I had done so and reiterated my problem, but to look at past correspondence so that they can see and unblock my account. I receive an email back a few days later (by the sounds of it not even bothering to look at the whole story!) advising they have known known issues for logging in. Try another PC or use my mobile. And then kindly asked me to leave a review of my experience!! I replied AGAIN advising my situation and asking them to look back and see I have followed their instructions but I am just going round in circles. Surprise surprise; a few days later I receive an email apologising for issues and to reset my password and to email back advising I have done so. THE EXACT WORD FOR WORD EMAIL TEMPLATE.

Mackenzie McHugh,2019-09-20T05:16:50Z,LITERAL WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I’VE EVER EXPERIENCED !!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the LITERAL worst company to buy from. So unreliable, rude, and self serving. I mean it when I say you’d be better off stuffing your money down a garage disposal and turning it on. I gave them 1 star because negative infinity stars isn’t an option. Please read my ASOS horror story below and I thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 

I ordered a pair of pants from ASOS and paid extra for expedited shipping so they would arrive on time for me to wear them to an event. My package arrived, and inside it was a dress I had not ordered and no pants. I contacted ASOS to correct the issue and they essentially said it was my responsibility to correct their mistake by sending the item back, waiting 10 days for a refund, and then re ordering the pants IF they still happen to have them in my size. This is an item I already paid for and now I have to go order it again but only if it’s still available at which point it certainly won’t be on time for my event. 

So I sent the dress back, waited 10 days for my refund, and did not order a new pair of pants because by this time it didn’t matter. It was too late. I had already asked why they weren’t falling all over themselves to apologetically overnight me my real order, but of course, they sent an automated message about what I need to do to fix THEIR MISTAKE. I finally received my refund but it was missing 9 dollars which turned out to be the extra shipping charge! They did NOT refund me for the shipping even though this was a service I paid for that I did not receive! After contacting them about it AGAIN, they told me they were not going to refund the shipping, sent me some automated messages, told me there was no one higher up I could talk to, and ended the chat before I could say anything. 

Think about this: if I had reordered those pants like they told me was my only option if I still wanted them, I would have to pay ANOTHER shipping charge to get them to me, and the last one wasn’t even refunded! That means I basically paid this company to send me something I didn’t want, and then for me to send it back. That’s what I paid for. And they think it’s legal to just not give me my money back due to their falter. 
Its not about the $9 dollars, it’s a matter of principal and compensation for the incredibly demeaning and infuriating service I received at this point.",1,ASOS,1

The service I have received has been truly awful. Firstly, I purchased the premium delivery, in which I expect my delivery to therefore arrive the next day... & it didn't.
I contacted DPD as I defended Asos saying that this wasn't their problem, for DPD to tell me that the barcode label was scratched so they sent it to the wrong sorting office.
I then am told to contact Asos, as this is the only way I'd be able to receive some type of help.
Upon contacting Asos, they proceed to tell me that these things happen, but I've now read multiple reviews where similar things have happened to other customers which makes me really question the ""Premium delivery"". I understand that it states, if high periods of time, this can mean a delay in the postage however, I was told there's ""a scratch on the barcode"" which hence, the slow delivery (as mentioned sent to the wrong sorting office.)
I've now been in contact with Graham, for well over an hour, and have been told that I can have a refund for the premium delivery but this will no longer commence (despite how much I've been put out). Since, I decided to then state I'd like a refund for everything and wish for DPD not to deliver so I've now been told this can take a total of 17 days for a refund to actually come through.
I'm honestly really disappointed.
The items I've purchased were meant to be a birthday present, very much an addition and last minute (admittedly my fault) but when spending lots of money and expecting a service to find it's not meeting ts expectations is just really frustrating.
I will no longer be shopping with Asos, despite the 'complimentary 10% discount voucher'. It's not worth the hassle.
P.S Graham has tried to be really helpful and spent ages with me but I feel as though what they're trained at Asos isn't to a good enough standard. With the situation though, Graham - thank you for your patience and time.",1,ASOS,1

They do not keep their customer's informed when things go wrong, and it takes a lot of work from customers to get an answer (however I've have found it impossible to actually get anymore information other than ""sorry, theres been an issue"").

Upon receipt of the items i realised that one that they had sent to me was completely the wrong thing and was worth a lot less than what i ordered, 

i spoke with their office and asked them to re-send the right thing, they said i would need to return what i had (going out of my way to return somethign that was worthless - £1.50 to be precise) i wasnt very happy to do so as im also heavily pregnant and rather unwell (hence the online deliveries of clothing)- not that that bothered them. 
I reluctantly took the item back to a collect plus point to return it, once i had returned it they said that because my original item (that they were meant to deliver) was worth less than the £25 discount applied, and they no longer had stock of that item, that i was due NOTHING BACK. 

so not only do i not have the crap £1.50 item, i am also out of pocket for returning that item and no better off. 

i am so disappointed with how they have handled my query and they have done nothing to help me or assist in this situation, i was hung up on at one time, and also i was told (after multiple phone conversations) that they dont even have a call centre... which they do!

My package got lost in the mail and they gave me the run around for weeks. Still don't have my clothes or a refund of my $225. They ask you to call back at a later date and promise that it'll be resolved then. Then you call, and they give you another further date to call back at. When you ask them what they will do to resolve it at the future date, they say they can't advise you of that. It's such a terrible customer service experience. I wanted to cry out of frustration.

After going through the reviews I asked them to send me a new pair and once I will receive it, I will send them back the faulty one. They keep insisting that I should send the faulty pair firstly. What if it will be out of stock or what if they will just keep the money and not send me the new pair.

ASOS use to use DPD who are excellent but they have changed to Hermes and they are HORRENDOUS! Tracking stayed the same even after the time slot given so i contacted Hermes and they said someone would be in touch within 24 hours. That time passed and no one had contacted me. So i contacted them again and they said they couldnt find the address (funny as its off a main road and its an old terrace not like its a new post code or anything, never had any issues in the past) So i gave them directions and they said they would try to deliver again. That never happened, the next time I tried to contact them they said ASOS had given them the wrong address. So I contacted ASOS to complain and they said they had given the correct address and that I needed to contact Hermes again, oh and they wouldnt refund the next day delivery. So I contacted Hermes again who said i needed to speak with ASOS (apparently these companies for whatever reason can't talk to each other) then suddenly Hermes updated with some random address, which I googled and found out its the ASOS returns centre (i hadnt been contacted or sent an email to say this was being returned)

Every time i tried to speak with anyone from ASOS and Hermes they were completely useless and no one could give me any answers. I havent yet been refunded for this order. I decided to place the order again as I wanted these items for my holiday and shock, the second parcel also hasnt arrived!!! Absolutely raging.

Contacted customer service who said they would get back to me within 48 hours. It’s now 3 days later and I’ve had to chase again . I’ve now been told they will contact me in 24 hours and surprisingly asked for a comment on trustpilot, which is really annoying as they think that’s customer service . 

I’m contacting their CEO today about this .

I am appalled that ASOS finds it acceptable to ship damaged shoes to customers in the expectation that they would actually keep them. When I tried to initiate a return, I realized the packing slip they provided was for a completely different person and order. So now probably someone else has my personal information in their defective order, just like I have some random person's information. 

I've tried three times to get headway with ASOS customer service and they're awful. The first time no one responded after 5 minutes of initiating a chat. The second time I asked them to tell me what exactly happens with returned shoes, and whether they intend to resell them to someone else (I am sure I received someone's damaged shoes). They allege they would take the product out of their stock, but clearly that isn't the case given the state of the product I received. The third time I told them I received someone else's packing slip and can't even initiate a return with it. I asked for a link to where I can file a formal complaint, and conveniently [for them] they do not have one. Then I asked for the email addresses of departments that are in charge of quality assurance or corporate responsibility, etc. Again, no go. I finally asked what exactly ASOS does to achieve customer service if there is no way to accept feedback to improve. The agent said that customers can ""chat online."" 

Clearly ASOS is stuck in a perpetual model of customer dissatisfaction with poor-quality apparel that they think is passable. What a horrible company. I am disgusted by the way they treat their customers. This company is a scam.",1,ASOS,1

Unfortunately, it’s been over a month and I still have not received my first order. When I requested a refund for my subscription they said I’ve already been member for a month so I’m not qualified for a refund. Mind you I’ve been a customer since 2015. It’s been frustrating for the past 3 days trying to get refunded. One response I received told me that I can get refunded and then when I replied ‘yes’, another rep says they can’t refund me.

First I tried to chat online with an agent. She said hi and disappeared. I kept waiting for more than 15minutes. I texted again to no avail so I ended the chat. Shortly after, I started another chat  and I was informed that the premier delivery won't work for my international shipping just to be informed by a third agent after I placed my order with standard shipping that it would have worked. I contacted them the third time to make sure my sizes were correct since the UK store provides different conversions than the US store. Everyone tells me something different until it finally became clear to me that I got the wrong sizes. So I contacted them for a fourth time to cancel my order but they would not do it because 60mins have passed since I placed my order. Of course it passed while I was moving from inept agent to another seeking information and help. I tried to at least have them amend the order and they wouldn't either. The thing is the estimated delivery date is too late for me. I'm traveling and won't be back before end of August and they keep repeating that I could return the order. They are robots. They copy-paste the same response to all concerns. How am I going to return it if I will be gone by the time it arrives?! Worse yet, I only have 45 days to return and they would not extend it since they are the reason I am in this miserable situation. After I insisted to talk to a manager or someone who could help, Patrick who has been talking like a robot decided to end the chat. The shady business is run by a bunch of pathetic, incompetent and dishonest agents. Story short is because of their poor handling of the situation and misleading customer service, I now ended up with an order that has wrong sizes, won't arrive on time and won't be able to return within their 45days.

Natasha ,2019-08-17T18:36:53Z,Canadian Buyers Beware!,"Canadian Buyers Beware!

I have never once written a review on a clothing company, but I feel like I need to put a warning out to the Canadian buyers. 

I ordered two of the same dress from ASOS because I was unsure about the sizing and wanted to make sure I got the right fit. My order total came to $150.23 and I was surprised to pay $45.08 in duty fees at the post office. Honestly, I was annoyed, but I was willing to let it go. That was until I got home and opened my package to find that I was sent two different dresses. The dress that I actually ordered, unfortunately, is slightly too small and so I will not be able to wear it. The other dress... well it's just not what I ordered.  So now in order to return these items, I have to pay $25.00, which is on top of the $45.08 in duty fees that I already paid, for two dresses that I won't even own. 

So I would pay $70.00 to not own these dresses. That just doesn't seem right to me...

I got in touch with customer service and asked if they had any way to reimburse me for the duty fees or at lease cover the return shipping fee since they are the ones who sent me the wrong dress. They said that they would not be able to discuss options until they have the items back in their warehouse. 

So I'm left with two options:
1. Keeping these dresses, even though one doesn't fit and the other is not something I ordered, nor would I wear.

2. Paying $25.00 to return these items, and also not getting reimbursed for the $45.00 in duty. So pay $70.00 to not own these items. Seriously... 

Lesson learned... it is not worth shopping here if you are Canadian.",1,ASOS,1

I did not get an explanation, only an invitation to re-purchase Premiere Delivery.  I don't think so!  I have now written to ASOS and requested that my account be closed.  I will not be buying from this company in future which is a shame because I have always loved doing so.  This company appears to have changed completely over the years I have been buying from them.

This shipment then got stuck in customs for 10 days where I would talk to Asos on their customer service chat or email and they would tell me to talk to the shipper, UPS, but when I would call UPS they told me the paperwork was incorrect and Asos did not give them a tax ID and that Asos would need to correct the situation to get this released from customs. Asos customer service was absolutely no help whatsoever and eventually after speaking with UPS several times I was able to have them release the shipment to me by providing my personal Tax ID. THEN when the package finally arrived on 12/6 (I had paid for 2-3 day expidited shipping) UPS came to deliver the packages and would not release them to me unless I gave them my credit card to the delivery man to charge me over $1200 in duties!!! Outrageous, so I refused the order.

On 12/20 it had been two weeks since I refused shipment and sent my packages back to Asos on 12/6. So I emailed their customer service to find out when I will be refunded. They told me the shipment is still in transit and it should reach their warehouse by 12/28.

Now I have just emailed them again and they told me they will receive the shipment in another 14 days and that it will then take 5-10 days for refund.

After many emails back and forth with customer service, which every time seemed to be a different person that did not read or understand at all the previous email communications regarding this issue they kep apologizing that I have not yet received my package and offered no help, no explanation and no shipment tracking so that I can track the package myself to see when it will arrive at their warehouse.

I’ve contacted ASOS they have confirmed the driver did not follow procedure (he forged a signature, didn’t take a picture of where he so say left the parcel).

Gary Murray,2018-12-04T16:38:50Z,One star is FAR too good.,"One star is FAR too good.

Placed an order for £110 on a Thursday 29th November 2018, evening @ 11pm thinking I'd selected next day delivery, which I quickly realised the next morning I hadn't. So I got through to chat and asked if I could upgrade delivery. They said I couldn't and that I'd need to wait for delivery the following Friday (8th December 2018).

At this point I decided I'd cancel my order as I needed the items that weekend, and unfortunately it was pointless me waiting for another 8 days for items I'd no longer want/need.

I went and purchased some of the items elsewhere and got next day delivery no issue, great I thought. I'll just cancel my order now with ASOS as it's not needed. So less than 12 hours after placing my order, I get told no ""you cannot cancel, you have 1 hour to cancel after placing it"". So ASOS are telling me I can't cancel an order I no longer want, and will have to wait for items to be dispatched out to me (in 8 days time), then once they've been delivered get them returned myself back to ASOS, then wait for them to receive them back, then wait up to another 5 days for a refund... What kind of company CAN'T CANCEL AN ORDER 8 days before delivering it?

I complained that it didn't make sense for them to spend money sending something to me that I don't want, and then me have to send it back, so they said they'd escalate and call me back that day - which to be fair they did. On the call the staff member advised me that they would be able to cancel, but only once I get my dispatch notification and tracking information. Very polite, no issues I though.

So I wait ALL weekend, then on Monday (3rd December 2018) contact them now I have the tracking number. I then get told I have to wait until it's active as the tracking number doesn't work just yet. Okay, fair enough I though. So I wait another 24 hours. Once tracking is now working I speak to them again ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY CANNOT CANCEL MY ORDER AGAIN!!!

WHAT ON EARTH!

I am now told I again have to wait for the items to arrive, then send them back myself. An order I DO NOT WANT.

I've ordered many times with ASOS before and never had any real issues, but I will not be shopping with them again, and suggest others AVOID AVOID AVOID.

By law, any customer purchasing online in the UK has LEGALLY got 14 days from delivery being made to them to cancel an order. And being told I cannot cancel until I have had the goods sent is just ridiculous. It literally makes no sense.

Apologies for the rant, but I feel I should get my experience across - it's just anti-consumer and such a massive mess on. I guarantee it is like this in order to stress/confuse people into submission and into doing what ASOS want. They are not helpful at all!

Await your response ASOS, but judging by your other reviews, I don't hold out any hope of getting a resolution and am resigned to not seeing my £110.99 until about 5 weeks time :(

Not even for the shipping and so on... Can you imagine what service is that? Basically for their mistake I need to pay twice the custom plus shipping and wait 30 or more days for a refund or  I need to purchase a new one and pay all over again all the fees plus shipping!!!

I spent 100 dollars on a dress that came in and looked like a literal costume. Nothing like the picture. An awful cheap material and stitching.

I also got a white bodysuit. The material was so thin you could see my belly button through it. 

Also, my clothing all had an awful smell to it.. I will be returning for a refund.

I received the same automated response back, but they also added “We will not be providing you with any more details with regards to this as your account has now been deactivated.  We reserve the right to close your account.” Um. What? I’ve never been so disappointed with a company and their lack of ‘customer care’.

So I did but this time I was told there was nothing they could do until 7 working days after the last time the parcel was tracked. I was told by customer services the date I needed to get back in touch for them to resolve my issue was today (15th May). I also expressed my wish to complain at this point and the customer service advisor said they would pass my complaint on.

I purchased an outfit for a special upcoming event that I needed it for with plenty of time to spare. While this was the main reason for ordering from them, I also purchased some other things I liked. I paid to have my order shipped to my house by November 26th and on my order information, this was written by THEM very clearly. After my order didn't arrive on the 26th, I gave it a couple of days in hopes that maybe it was just delayed due to the holidays. Finally after 2 weeks of no tracking updates, I called the tracking company to see where my package was. They informed me that ASOS never sent them the package. After multiple attempts to contact ASOS with no luck, I was finally sent an email that ""there were complications with my order"" and that I would be reimbursed. Well now I have no outfit for my event, I still haven't been reimbursed, and the last person who I talked to via online chat (Rhia) rudely sent me a link to reorder all of my items (which I haven't been reimbursed for nor received) and then she left the chat without any further assistance. Finally I decided to bite the bullet and just place a completely new order of all the items I never received but paid for, and they were out of stock in my size in 4 of the items. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from ASOS ever again and would not recommend anyone chance going through this process with a company of such awful customer service.",1,ASOS,1

I contacted customer service through an online chat to tell them about what had happened but was asked if I had taken any pictures. I don’t know how you would be able to take pictures of that lol. The person I talked to regarding this was Janine and not only did the process take 24 minutes (she took a long time to respond) but she was also rude. I do most of my shopping online and I have never dealt with customer service this horrible. Do not purchase anything from this store, not only do they cheat their customers but they also don’t value them. The clothes are ill-fitted and not very original; you can find most of the same styles elsewhere. Save your money and purchase from a company where you matter.",1,ASOS,1

Have sent them around 10 emails in total over the past 1.5 months trying to resolve it - finally got to the point of them saying they would refund, now waiting over a week for the refund. Asked today for the transaction reference or some details but they are unable to provide anything. Have used Asos almost exclusively for online clothes shopping for well over 5 years, recommended them to many people, but will obviously no longer dos so.

But if you return an item ASOS take all the discount off the returned item so you get a refund of the amount paid minus ALLl the discount and you are expected to pay the FULL non discounted price on the item you kept.

JD,2019-06-12T08:01:10Z,I have been a very good and very loyal…,"For 8 years I have been a very good and very loyal Asos' customer: in fact, pretty everything I was buying was coming from their website. Troubles were rare and I had full satisfaction about this e-seller that I was using on a really regular basis (often monthly) and that I was recommending to everyone around me.

However, these last years Asos' quality has started to lower and lower on several levels: first on quality products, then on prices and promotion codes (which don't even exist anymore), on deliveries efficiency and finally, on customer service effectiveness. 
This is the first time of my life that I write an online review.

My last order was a huge joke. 
Not only it arrived super late (2 weeks after ordering), not only they didn't warn me about this delay, not only they didn't inform about 2 products being out of stock and going to miss in the parcel, not only they took my money way before shipment (including the cost of the 2 missing items),  but their customer service happened to be a complete nonsense, totally disrespectful as well as useless: 2 ways of reaching them: 1- Email (nobody answers) 2- Tchat' (automatic-bot agents unable to help who'll close the window if you're not okay with their absurd answers). 

I am very disappointed. This is not just about orders being ""less"" satisfying but being really awful, a big waste of time, money and nerves, when we exactly use e-shop to save time, money and nerve... 
After around 5 tchat's and 4 emails trying to fix it, I'm still waiting for the rest of my products, my due refund, not speaking about a fair compensation. 

I'm done. This was my very last Asos order and I hope that all customers will find various ways to express their genuine discontent.
This is not a way to treat people you take money from, people you call ""clients"".",1,ASOS,1

Then I’ve ordered T-shirt for my boyfriend in size L, they’ve sent me M. The final and worst case is I’ve ordered puma sandals for kinda big price and the item I’ve got was absolutely different, DIDNT MATCH the description at all and costed 1/3 less on other websites.

Contacted them for a refund.  First operator cut me off as apparently I was too slow answering.  Second operator point blank refused to help saying I had to give at least another 5 days for delivery to arrive even though that will make it almost two weeks late and I will be away on holiday by then.

I have contacted customer service several times with ASOS and I can honestly say it is THE WORST CS I've ever received. None of my needs have ever been met and I am and have been for many years, a regular customer. I have NEVER felt valued and the last time was no different. I was offered to pay for a service on the UK site for free 2 day delivery to US (I moved there recently). Thought that was great so I did pay for only to be told after trying to get answers for over a week that even though premier delivery two shipping to the US only to be told that in fact I cannot use it on the UK site and there was nothing they were going to do about it. Asos won't even refund me the $12! It's not the money..its the gesture. I don't need $12 feel that it is a fair to offer that solution to me. 

I believe this is terrible customer service and just adds to the long line to bad service I've received for years. I've tweeted, I've gone online, I've emailed. No difference in the poor level of service. And to top it off they have no complaints department.

Multiple requests to be called were ignored. The best that they can do is contact dpd again. The call centre are also on a script which makes dealing with them so frustrating.

Kathy H. ,2018-12-26T14:23:13Z,Terrible company. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!,"i ordered a pair of men's shoes for my son on black friday with an estimated delivery of approx. 5 business days. i received a notice that due to an airport delay, it would arrive about 3 days later.  The item i ordered was for Christmas, so it wasn't too big a deal.  When the item arrived, the shoes were damage (scratched) and dented.  i took photos of the item and started a chat with them because you can NEVER speak with a person. There is no phone number you can call to actually speak to a person! So they said they would send me out the correct pair and i could pay myself to return them and at some point would reimburse me for the shipping, What?  Just send me a return label! I am not going out of pocket to return your damaged item. So when the other shoe arrived, it was totally the wrong shoe.  it didn't even look like the shoe i ordered! Of course, i had to go back on chat and tell them of the situation.  I also took photos of the wrong shoe for them to review.  Now by this time its crunch time for christmas, so they told me there was nothing more they can do for me except to refund me the amount of the original purchase.  so i politely asked (on chat) what about the shoe i need for Christmas, are you going to send me the correct undamaged shoe that i have been waiting on?  I told them i would gladly return the ones they sent. i was instructed that i would have to pay again for the shoe i had already paid for and they would refund me once they receive the damaged one back. Wait, so i am paying twice and i still don't have what i ordered and of course they said it would not arrive in time for Christmas because yeah, you guys don't know how to process orders properly! Needless to say, i am putting these back in the mail and i told my son i would NEVER order anything else from this vile company.  i only gave it one star because i couldn't give it a zero.

Josh Heynen,2018-12-26T01:43:02Z,Gift did not arrive on time - no compensation,"I ordered a gift on December 16, paid $4 for shipping and it said it would arrive by Christmas eve. Late Christmas evening when it hadn't arrived, I contacted customer service being chat (as it is the only way to contact them) and was promised it would arrive by 10 PM or something could be done to compensate me. It did not arrive. I contacted customer service again and they told me to allow until JANUARY 7 for it to arrive. They would not even refund my delivery charge, and Christmas was ruined for my brother who did not receive a gift due to this error.

Additionally, the track order link did not provide any information from my order. Amesha at customer service did give me the tracking information, but it wasn't available to me at the link provided. Their forecast delivery time was hugely optimistic to get here from Spain, as they sent it through the USPS normal mail.

They told me to wait a month to see if it just magically shows up at my address and then another month to ensure that I haven’t gotten it. I still haven’t gotten my refund.

I've ordered some things from Asos in the past, and they've always taken WEEKS to arrive without any confirmation numbers or tracking numbers.

In my most recent order, I had purchased 3 items. One of the items was COMPLETELY incorrect. I had bough a medium size floral body suit... and the item that came was tiny tank top body suit (definitely a fraction of the price I paid for the floral body suit).

I promptly returned the incorrect item with the return slip that came with the order. And have not heard back in 3 weeks...
I chatted with a customer service rep, and she was completely useless. She wanted me to provide proof of postage and the item # of the incorrect item. How the f*** am I supposed to provide the item # of the incorrect item, when the item was INCORRECT?!?! The receipt had the CORRECT item listed... and I got some random piece of s*** in the mail...

I asked the customer service rep, ""is there ANYTHING you can do for me in this situation? You guys sent me an incorrect item. And I followed all the return policies and procedures."" 
She straight up told me ""No. You are responsible for the item up until it's in our posession.""

I haven't been shopping lately, and I never bought from ASOS before, so I don't know how big or small their stuff runs. So I entered some data about my height, weight and body type into their (useless) AI and used their fit assistant to tell me what size to buy for my purchases. I was a trusting fool, let me tell you. I feel so stupid now. Everything I received was WAY to big. EVERYTHING (not to mention super crap-a-licious quality). I had to return ALL of the items (this costs 10 bucks) and I asked them to refund the 20 bucks I spent on the next day shipping. Reason being that I had trusted them that their fit assistant recommendations were of SOME use, but I ended up having to send back the ENTIRE 13 item order when not one item fit! I can understand that some things probably will not fit...but everything??? You can bet your bottom dollar that they didn't give a flying **, and just said that it is the customer's responsibility to order the right size and that they take no responsibility for their fit assistant. If you are a first time customer and you can't try on the darn clothes, how are you supposed to know how they fit?! You might foolishly trust their silly and deceitful AI! Why do they have that thing if it doesn't work AT ALL? This is a great way to lose a first time customer who was willing to dole out 400 bucks. I guess they have no interest in retaining customers. You would think that you can put some amount of faith in a large retailer like this. You can't. I wish that I had read reviews on Trustpilot first, I never should have ordered with them in the first place. Now I am just afraid that I won't get my refund.

I did, and they just asked me to wait some more. Finally when they actually decided to check, they tried to reship the item but it was out of stock. By that time I didn't want the item anyway. Eventually they decided to do a refund but they refunded me the wrong amount. I had to write in yet again to get the full amount. Dealing with them was a nightmare. I won't ever use asos again.",1,ASOS,1
cgee,2019-04-06T15:17:07Z,I'd give no stars if I could...,"Had the same exact experience as Emma Martyn below. Placed an order, was told it was shipped & the estimated arrival date, but received zero tracking information. When it was past the estimated date & I still hadn't heard any updates, I contacted customer care, who told me tracking numbers would be provided & I should expect to receive my order the following week. No tracking number was ever updated on the site (they didn't even update the arrival date on there).

*That* estimated arrival date was 3 days ago, I reached out to customer care again today and was told that it was being sent back to the warehouse due to not being picked up from the access point. Which, again, I received no notification nor tracking detail to inform me that it had even arrived there. And instead of just sending me the items that I paid for and still want (including a pair of shoes that are no longer even on the website), I'm expected to get a refund by MAY (aka 2 months after initially purchasing) and should apparently try to buy the items again then. 

I think the most maddening point of this whole experience is how ASOS and its customer care team refuse to acknowledge any responsibility or take accountability despite the fact that I'm clearly not the only person this has happened to. Definitely won't be buying from them again, which is sad because other than this I've had little to no problems with them. As someone who's worked in retail I typically hate complaining online/publicly/at all, but man, this truly sucked.",1,ASOS,1
Emma Martyn,2019-04-06T14:03:07Z,Last week I ordered clothes for a…,"Last week I ordered clothes for a holiday in a weeks time - effectively leaving 2 weeks for delivery. I was meant to receive my order on Wednesday. Followed up today (a Saturday) to see where it was, only to find out it has been returned to the depot due to attempted delivery attempts. There was no card or phone call made to notify me of attempted delivery and I received two other deliveries this week with no issues. When I contacted their customer service I was told I could not  have my parcel returned to me and would be given credit on the gift card I used to purchase the clothes. This would be put on my account by the day before I go on holiday, therefore rendering this useless to me. I have asked for a refund on the gift card which again was refused. 

Not sure what the point of having an online business is if you are unable to receive the goods you order in a timely manner. I’m stuck with a £50 credit to be spent on goods I may or may not receive. 

Won’t be shopping with ASOS again.",1,ASOS,1

There has been no reaction, no refund, no e-mail for about a month.

We have sent several e-mail to the customer service, we have never got any response. We have tried the chat several times. After having waited for an hour, we finally could talk to someone. We always got the same copy-paste response. I have never been this furious. Having googled the CEO's e-mail address, I have sent a complaint.

Guess what? The mail has been transferred to the customer service and I got, once again, a copy-paste response that didn't answer my question at all. Shame on you, ASOS. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered.

When I received any order confirmation however, the delivery date was with standard delivery. I reached out to ASOS through chat (because, annoyingly, they do not have a phone number) and received absolutely no help at all. I waited up to TWENTY MINUTES for a response at times, and at other times the customer service agent literally answered a question of mine by copying and pasting a line from the ASOS website. The rep said that he was ""transferring my query to a team of specialists""---aka passing the baton and trying to get rid of me--and could not give me any timeframe as to when they would contact me. When I became frustrated, the customer service rep ENDED THE CHAT. Completely unacceptable customer service.

Linda Ess,2019-06-10T18:07:51Z,No packing slip or order confirmation makes return impossible,"1. I placed an order and paid with PayPal.

2. PayPal sent confirmation of my order.  ASOS did not.

3. 1st support representative with whom I chatted (literally - as there is no phone support) told me that I did not receive a conformation email because the order did not truly go through.  There was a breakdown in order transmission from PayPal to ASOS and I guess I was to believe that my order had been cancelled...?

4.  I was on the fence about size, so I ordered a different size of the same item from a different site.

5.  Lo and Behold!  I received the item I ordered from ASOS.  I also received the item from the other vendor.  Order from Other Vendor fits.  Item ordered from ASOS does not.

Now, that I've prefaced the situation.....I need to return the item ordered from ASOS.  Two things are required to make a return.

a) an order #
b) a Returns Note (aka a packing slip, a reason for the return, etc.)
c) a shipping label

Regarding the 1st:  I was to have gotten ""a)"" when I placed the order.  (It took chatting with a 2nd support rep for :15 to determine that I had miskeyed my email address.  But she could not change it, resend the confirmation email, or even TELL me what my order # was)

Regarding the 2nd and the 3rd:  Both items were to have been included in my received order.  Neither of them were.

Zach Savage,2019-07-01T15:13:33Z,"WON'T REFUND ME, PUT ME THROUGH ENDLESS LOOPS","Dear ASOS, 

I am writing this hoping that someone will see it and be able to help me as I find myself in the worst experience I have ever had with an online store. 

I placed an order with ASOS on Monday March 19th and received it not long after that. After trying the different items within this order I decided to return some things.
When I went to return this order I had realised that the card I used to buy these items was stolen from me. Because that card was stolen from me I closed the bank account associated with that card. That bank account was closed on April 3rd. I notified your customer service team about this before returning these items and you assured me that it would not be an issue and that you would help me obtain my refund. Once the refund was ""processed"" you had informed me that the bank account that I had closed accepted the refund and that I needed to get in contact with that bank in order to receive my refund. I went into the bank and told them what you had said and they told me that my bank account was indeed closed and that it was impossible for any funds to have gone into it. They double checked and confirmed that there was no refund. I replied back and told you this, you told me to go back to the bank and have them right a personal letter stating that my bank account was closed (this after I already gave you my closing bank statement). I went back to the bank and explained to them what you requested of me. They explained that they never do this and that I should only need a closing bank statement. After much discussion they finally gave me a personal letter stating that my bank account was indeed closed on April 3rd. I gave you this letter and you agreed to do a ""one off"" to refund me to my current bank account.

Fast forward to now. I decided to make a second return on that same order on April 26th. I wanted to avoid any sort of confusion & frustration on this second return as it was purchased on the same stolen card/bank account. To be safe I got in contact with your customer care team and asked them to help make sure that the refund didn't go to that old card (which i deleted off my account because you said it would solve issues). You promised me that if there were any issues that you would help me get my refund to my current bank account.

Sure enough, the same thing happened the second time as did the first. You replied to me saying that my old bank account had accepted my refund. Frustrated at this point I contacted you again and explained that this bank account was closed and it had been closed since April 3rd. Since that contact with you I have had 24 back and forth emails, 15 online chat sessions, DM's to your social media accounts, 2 calls from your team telling me to go back into the bank, gone back and forth to and from the bank having them write multiple letters telling you that they don't have my refund money and I am so far beyond frustrated. You constantly tell me to do something to prove that they don't have the money, then I do that and you still tell me that there is nothing you can do. 

The simple reality is that I don't have my refund and you have made me go through so many loops over these last couple of months to try and obtain it. I have done everything that you have requested and it still isnt enough for you to give me my proper refund. WHEN WILL YOU GIVE ME MY REFUND? Please have someone who has common sense look at my case and organise my refund. I have tried to be nice but after months of this and over 50 forms of communication I am at the end of my rope. 

I am severely disappointed in the way I have been treated and I am sure I am not the only one.",1,ASOS,1
Christina Mary Nicole,2019-07-01T13:53:14Z,Asos threatened to deactivate my account,"I got the same email today as the previous reviewer here. Threatening to deactivate my account and lumping me in the same category with people who ""return clothes they can't use,"" even though every garment I buy, I return after gently trying on once.  I've also only made three orders ever, and the main reason I returned the Aso brand clothes that I bought was because they looked cheap.   One of the Aso design tops was a satin camisole. I liked it, but it had this weird facing at the top that ended at my nipples and made them look pointy.  I've been willing to keep giving them a chance because the site is convenient and there are lots of brands on their site to choose from. My guess would be a successful purchase is hit-or-miss, but after this treatment I will not be shopping with them anymore or supporting their business. If they are trying to scare away customers with their fear-mongering tactics, then they are doing a great job.

I digress, the point it threatening your customers is a terrible business strategy.  I can't explain how angry it makes me that a business I've purchased from, return or not, would attempt to threaten. Maybe their business isn't doing so great and they've gotten desperate. It doesn't matter because I no longer support them.",1,ASOS,1

Noting that i had the event that i am supposed to wear the dress that i ordered on the 24th of June.

Anna Skovrup,2019-07-01T11:01:18Z,I had the worst experience with asos,"I had the worst experience with asos. I bought four items on the 10th of June 2019. On the 14th I received an e-mail with a tracking number. On the 19th the tracking device stated that the parcel would be delivered on the 19th. But nothing happened and the parcel didn't get delivered. So I wrote to customer service, who asked me to hold my patience until the 27th. On the 27th the parcel still wasn't delivered. So I wrote again on the the 27th and the 28th, but with no answer. Again I wrote on the 1st of July - this time with reply. Apparently the parcel had been lost. So instead they ordered a replacement order. But in the meantime one of the items had been sold out, so this wouldn't be included in the new order. Furthermore two of the items were ordered with wrong sizes. So again I had to write customer-service to have this fixed. Apparently the e-mail had wrongly stated that the sold-out item would not be included as it was actually one of the other items with the wrong size. As regards he other item with the wrong size at first they wouldn't admit that they had ordered it wrong, but as they admitted the size was actually wrong, they didn't want to do anything about it even though I wrote to them less than an hour after receiving the e-mail regarding the replacement order. So now I'm receiving an item that dosen't fit and I have to use more useless time on returning it. This whole experience have been so confusing and with such bad service.

This may be why they haven't been able to deliver this. We're unable to amend the delivery address your order is being sent to. If it's returned to us, a refund will then be issued and you'll receive an email to let you know. Please log into 'My Account', remove the incorrect postcode and update your address book with your current postcode to prevent this from happening with any future orders. I would personally e=get in touch with Hermes and advise them on the correct post code!
HERMES web site is very difficult to use and i have tried calling them and it is impossible to get through, how long does it normally take to be returned?

They arrived all right, with one shoe in the box! I contact them, explaining my situation and all they tell me to do is send them back. No offer to fix their mistake, but instead make an excuse that they're sold out (which they were not, since I had to shell out another 53 bucks to buy another pair), and that they cannot send them. I instead suggest compensation, maybe free two-day, something that will guarantee I get my order when I was SUPPOSED to. Nope. They say it can't be done, no explanation or willingness to make right on their shortcomings. Now I'm waiting until January sometime. I'll never buy anything from here again.

Sarah A Powers,2019-07-19T13:19:38Z,Asos is weak,"Asos offers free returns so of course I found that helpful when shopping on their site for the first time for a jumpsuit. I ordered several different designs in several sizes since I didn’t know what my size would be in their clothing. Their business model seemed to be online only sales woth no brick and mortar so it made sense to me that they’d offer free returns. It was a large order and ultimately nothing fit except for ONE. I was hoping to keep 2-3 designs to have for different occasions. I made a second order to try different styles. They also didn’t fit and because they were sale items, the stock was low and I couldn’t order different sizes. So I decided to return both orders (value $400) and kept the one jumpsuit. I prepared them to mail using the labels that ASOS sent with the order. And I dropped them in the UPS secured pickup box in my building. One made it and was processed a few days later. The second and bigger one still isn’t made it and I’ve reached out several times by chat and email to Asos about this. They’re telling me they haven’t received it yet and need proof of postage. Well because I used the labels they sent, I don’t have proof of postage. It’s over $300 that I’ve lost and I’m real mad. I can’t believe they don’t have a call center because chat and email don’t suffice to problem solve- that must be done in person. Instead they just send me their canned responses. They also wouldn’t transfer me to a supervisor. I’ve NEVER had problems with other retailers like this- amazon, Wayfair, Pact, Gap, etc- they don’t ask for proof of postage and my returns have always been refunded. As well, the “proof of postage” language is not on the materials in the packaging that Asos includes so I followed the rules and now they’re telling me I’m wrong. They have “policies” that I have to follow but apparently my own policies don’t matter. I’ve asked them for proof they haven't received it but they disregard that. It’s crap.

When i checked the tracking again, it said they had requested it to be sent back to them. AND THEN the parcel had been recieved by my local depot! I phoned both DPD and ASOS who both told me nothing could be done. Dpd said that asos had to cancel the request and it could then be delivered to us today. After one phone call, a few emails and a online chat, I was told that they ""cant do anything"" and to wait 7 days for a refund before ordering again.. which is a complete joke, what happened to the investiagtion that was suppose to happen to see if it was being delivered? And what is with the automated chat and emails? Try talking to them to resovle issues and all you get is copy and pasted nonesense that has nothing to do with what you are saying! Put off majorly.

They then informed me that DPD were revisiting the place of delivery on Friday. Given what they have said they presumably should have come to my house but, of course, no one did. So I would now think they must have gone back to the address it was delivered to and either have the parcel or at very least know which house it was delivered to. Or they have admitted they have lost the parcel. But no they are still claiming the parcel has been delivered but have yet to provide any evidence that the goods have been delivered anywhere, nevermind to me. ASOS have refused replacement or refund which is as good as calling me a liar. I have been an ASOS customer fo mqny years and wasn't requesting a refund, I just wanted the goods I ordered to be delivered. Not an unreasonable request!

Neisha Young,2018-11-27T13:28:51Z,Hidden charges and potential delays,"Hidden charges and potential delays

Ordered some items to be sent internationally and annoying ASOS does not include all custom charges in their costs. They even decided to split one of my larger orders into two parcels which then incurred two import charges, even though they assured me that one order regardless of how many parcels will incur only one import charge. I contacted ASOS re this and was told to chase customs even though this happened because they decided to put it into two parcels. Regardless, they were the ones that submitted the documentation to customs so in my opinion they should be the ones calling customs and going through that headache. 

Another annoyance is that the payment of these fees delayed the shipment. Luckily, I was in country and received the email but this may not be the case for others.

The fact that there are additional hidden fees is not acceptable for such a large company. I frequently shop online with majority of purchases being sent from overseas and have not experienced this before.",1,ASOS,1

They con you with Spend and Save codes that I just found out mean you will not get a proper refund if you need it (this info is also really hard to find on the site). For two T-shirt’s I purchased during this sale (valued at $25 each) I received a $2.62 total refund. I thought oh wow, they must have made some mistake. Back and forth to the drones that they employ on the chat who do not give a s**t about your problem and actually ignored me when I said I was extremely unhappy with their service. I then proceeded to email them and even include their C.E.O in their email. Both times I received a drone on message that they’re sorry ‘I MISSED’ the information about returns with spend and save and that there’s nothing I can do. $2.62 does not even cover the postage I paid to send the T-shirt’s back. You’d think they would have seen this or after having received my complaint credited my account so I could at least exchange the items instead and not lose out, or at least offer me a discount code. I told them I won’t be shopping with them again and they just wrote the same email back to me in riddles of the basic message “WE DON’T GIVE A S**T”

Samuel Jones,2019-06-09T14:10:13Z,New top arrived from#asos stinking of sweat & perfume!!! (disgusting),"#asos uk  I  recently ordered a new top from ASOS, when i open the packaging this smelt very strongly of a woman's perfume and sweat! (disgusting). The label was loosely attached and due to the strong smell, I felt as if the top had been worn, and not just tried on. I did love the top, but they had run out of my size. I contacted customer services as I thought that a discount was warranted, because the top seemed to have been worn and smelt badly. I didnt think that it was fair to pay full price, but ASOS offered absolutely nothing. Firstly, I question how thoroughly they check returns, this top really stank. Secondly, the customer service offered by this company is abysmal.They kept telling me they were doing all they could, which turned out to be nothing.",1,ASOS,1

No sign of the parcel, I checked with my neighbours and any “safe place” they may have put it, still no parcel. I got in touch with customer care who said they’d take it up with DPD and would take 3-5 working days. A week goes by and I receive no update so follow it up myself, they say that the parcel was delivered correctly. I ask to see the signature and they send it across, literally a scribble, not my signature. I reply telling them this. They refuse to take it any further and say the case is closed. I am extremely frustrated with the customer service, they have not listened to me and not done all they can. I do not trust Asos delivery and customer care now and will no longer be using their service.

Gk,2019-06-29T05:01:13Z,If something goes wrong you're on your own,"I've been using asos for years and for the most part, everything works fine and no complaints.

However, I recently made an order with next day delivery. It just never dispatched. Asos' order page hasn't changed its status from ""We've got it!"", I haven't received an email that it's been dispatched nor have I received any notifications from any carriers saying I have a package on the way.

Customer service is f***** worthless. They give you a copy paste response about checking with your neighbours and post office. If you're not happy with this response, they will tell you to wait until the end of the day/wait until tomorrow/wait until this weekend/etc etc just so you leave.

Finally, my order was forwarded to their ""specialist team"" and you get no confirmation of this. Just sit and wait hoping this autistic seal team 6 finally gets in touch with you. I was told 24-48 hours for a specialist team response and 5 days later with no response, I get back in touch with support.

They tell me that I cannot get a refund for my order until this ""specialist team"" looks into what went wrong. What the f***. My order was never dispatched and it's 2 weeks past my original order date (with next day delivery) and they are telling me I can't have my money back for an order they never f****** sent out. They basically took my money, gave me nothing and still just tell me to wait.

The cherry on top is when they told me that because I contacted support again after 5 days of no response, I am relegated to the back of the support queue, meaning I have to start my wait for this magical specialist team all over again.

Absolutely f****** absurd, luckily I paid via PayPal and will be issuing a chargeback through them. 

Again, usually everything goes fine but God forbid something goes wrong and they just try to f*** you and f*** with you in every which way they can. It's absurd how f****** braindead their customer service policies are. Instead of helping a long term customer who has spent hundreds and thousands over the years and would continue to shop with them, they f*** them over on their own mistake for a £50 order.

I have to be honest - most of my orders have arrived without a problem - but when you have an issue, have in mind you'll be wasting your time contacting them.

It's probably the worst CS I've ever got - three times I've spoken to them for different issues and they don't seem to care about their customers experience, all they say is: it's on their ""T&Cs"", which at this point I may have to read the whole thing in case it says they can steal money from you.

My last issue was regarding a discount weekend they issued, where they offered a different discount according to your spending - I've met their conditions for the greatest amount but then had to return one item - Of course, I understand I don't meet the conditions for the full discount anymore, but was expecting them to honor the lower spending discount (since I meet those conditions).
Well, no. If you decide to spend more and for some reason return something, you'll lose any discount, even tho you still meet the conditions.  The worst? They don't care about your experience. They send you the link to their T&Cs and tell you there's nothing they can do (As I'm talking to a robot).

They clearly don't listen and show no empathy with their customers. I haven't even been told why they can't honor the promo (in a logical way, not only because of their policy) and they don't see to be looking for a solution for this concern in other to offer better policies for their customers.

Made an order on 10nov, shipped on 11nov with a promised est. delivery on 19nov
Great since I needed my stuff before 23nov!
19nov passed, I didn’t receive a single shït. 
I contacted asos only to be told that there was a delay in their carrier and I’ll definitely receive my long awaited items before 22nov
I held on to that promise but was met with “in transit” from 13nov till now (23nov) 
22nov passed, a friend who made her order a day after me had already received her purchases, her parcel status updated perfectly normal – step by step
I of course went on to contact asos yet again to question on the frozen status of my parcel on the very same day, was again told to give it some time and wait till the end of the day to contact them 
Thing is, my local courier stops delivering after 6pm! 
I have repeatedly mentioned this to their team but was always placated with the same generic response. 
When 22nd nov torturously ended, I went to chat with asos team again
It was only then that they admitted they had lost my parcel 
All these could have been shortened to a mere adimittance and an email from asos’ team

I now have to wait for a “specialist” to email me within 3days 
It’s unfortunately a huge sale season right now
If asos decides to send me another parcel, won’t I still have to expect long delays and very possible loss of parcels?

ASOS won't compensate the charge, saying it's 'out of their hands' when orders are delivered. That's fine if next day delivery is free, but when you pay extra for a service you don't receive, that's theft. When you cannot provide the service you're advertising to customers at extra charge, that's fraud. ASOS have, by far, the worst customer service ever.

In return, my account was blocked with the following communication and I’m now out of pocket $200 through no fault of my own.

“Thanks for sending that over ****. I can see that we emailed you around 11 hours ago to let you know that your account has been closed. I'll paste the contents of the email over here for you:

Hello,

After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a replacement of your item:

- Armani Exchange AX2099 chronograph gold stainless steel strap watch

It’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  

In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations.

Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account. In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled.

As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response ***.

Teresa Sousa,2019-06-28T09:31:19Z,GNEWT delivery,"ASOS recently started using a new delivery company called Gnewt. This company’s services are abismal. They allegedly attempt to deliver the parcel on 3 occasions however, they did not once leave an attempted delivery slip and I can see online that they did these 3 “attempts” were all around the same time on 3 consecutive workdays. Taking into account that most people work 9 to 5 I think it would have been only natural for gnewt to have let me rearrange the delivery after one failed delivery attempt rather than continue to try delivering my parcel at the same time the next 2 days. They also never contacted me to say that a delivery was attempted and it had failed, it was up to me to keep checking their tracking services to find this out. They also did not attempt to leave my package with my next door neighbour on any of the 3 occasions and he was home for all 3 deliveries as he is a pensioner. They also never informed me that my parcel was being returned to ASOS, on their online tracking it does say ""RTS"" which I know realise it means Return to Seller however there is no explanation of what this acronym means on their website. This is by far my worst experience with a delivery service, they do not make their costumers' life easy and seem unable to accommodate for anything.

Althought ASOS costumer service was responsive, they did not take the issue seriously and simply said I can reorder if I want.

I would have never placed the order in the first place if I knew how long shipping would take and how little information I would receive about where my order is. I emailed them about cancelling the order but instead was told yet again to wait until the 15th and it was out of their control. The email I received was passive aggressive despite the fact that I wasn't blaming anyone and just wanted to get my money back for the order I hadn't received. ""I'm sorry you were asked to wait"".

I got a refund but can't quite figure out why it didn't match what I paid except they must have taken out $ for return shipping? Maybe it's because of a currency difference (but not worth quibbling over)? Their receipt was very confusing. I would not trust buying anything with them again.

The package arrived on 04/01/2019 but the UPS delivery man would not release the package because it was shipped COD. I have already paid and the event I order the product for has already passed. Asos took no responsibility for communicating customs charges if incurred will be COD because they have statement about this on there help page. Why would I be on the help page when placing a simple order. If this is going to be their practice then it should be communicated during the check out process. In addition they are unwilling to compensate me for the  delayed delivery and embarrassment of having zero cash on me when the delivery arrived.

They have a few other options that are available for reaching out (and the chat is only available if you get it at the right time) which include FB messenger, tweeting, email, etc. I also sent them a FB message and am not having any movement on that end either.

This isn't normal. My gut tells me they don't have a lot of these items or are about to go bankrupt/out of business and are trying to rake in the last bit of $$$  they can before they need to pay it back. I've already notified my bank that I may be contesting a charge.",1,ASOS,1

Jonny Davies,2019-06-06T17:34:52Z,Baffling experience,"I made an order of 4-5 items which ended up being over 100 pound. Amazing! I am applicable for 20% off. Not quite, one of the shirts was too big, not trusting ASOS' exchange would be here in time before I went on holiday I ordered the medium instead on the same day hours after trying on the original shirt. 

The shirt was originally 25 pound so 20 pound after applying the discount, I really wanted the shirt so accepted I would have to pay full price for the correct size one. 

Later on holiday I received an email saying I had been refunded.... wait for it.... 1.80, yes 1.80 for a 25 pound shirt. I was expecting 20 pound as any normal human with a half working brain would. So I went to the livechat (waiting forever I should add), explained the situation, *keep in mind I had bought the exact same shirt and given them more money on the day of receiving my order* and was told because the refund took me under the 100 pound I wasn't entitled to the discount. 

At this point I looked at the screen and thought 'you must be joking'. Any normal company could see I bought the same shirt and would at least give me 20 pound if not maybe more for the hassle, NOT ASOS! I was told I could of exchanged the shirt and then this wouldn't of been the case, even though I have essentially done that myself whilst giving them more money and explained an exchange would take too long. I personally asked the person on the chat how she would feel in my position, ""I'm not aloud to give my opinion"", thank you for that you have made me feel like this is personal experience and I'm not talking to a robot (obvious sarcasm).

Eventually she suggested I should refund the new shirt that fits me hence why I bought it, I said the tags were off and she said I therefore couldn't refund it. These were her only two solutions? 

Finally she had the nerve to copy and paste the refund policy to which she had already told me I wasn't entitled too and left the chat herself whilst I was typing, lovely experience isn't it? 

The company have essentially stolen my money at this stage, 1.80 for a shirt, if I took both receipts in to any shop they would sort it out there and then. This experience was baffling and quite frankly a disgusting way to treat a customer that has made multiple and frequent orders from them.

It came written in the shoes 12 just that and on the website i bought size US 13!

zxzx,2018-11-20T04:50:00Z,This company is a JOKE,"This company is a JOKE. 
My order was supposed to arrive on 18/11/18 and prior to that I had used to online tracking service which they provide to ""enable customers to know the whereabouts of their items"". Placed the order on 10/11/18 and they stopped updating the status on 16/11/18. (So since then till now, 20/11/18, the status has been stuck at ""in-transit"".) 
On 18/11/18, I decided to go on their live chat and ask for assistance in checking the whereabouts of my order and all they could tell me was to ""Wait till the end of the day, if you haven't received it by then, we will look into it for you"". Mind you, I tried asking multiple times and all 4 CSO gave me the same reply. Fine, I waited it out and surprise surprise my order wasn't delivered on the promised date. So I tried getting assistance from the live chat again, one CSO completely ignored me, the next told me that there was nothing she could do to check the whereabouts of my order other than the same online tracking page customers go to as it isn't updated by asos but by the courier itself. She then proceeded to tell me to give it till 27/11/18.  So here's my question, why did I have to wait it out when all you're gonna tell me is what I see on the online tracking page?? ASOS PLEASE. But that's not the worse part, the worse part is when I was explaining my side of the story to this CSO called Devinia (i think that's how it's spelt), telling her my frustrations and how the live chat hasn't been helpful thus far, she said ""Please refrain from using abusive language"". Oh my god. Jesus. Lord help me. Never in any one of the chats had I used abusive language so you can imagine how taken aback I was. It's one thing to not be able to solve a customer's problem, but a whole other to just blatantly accuse them of something they did not do? Asos, please get it together.",1,ASOS,1

SIMONE,2018-11-18T16:55:29Z,ASOS delivery,"I am very annoyed and disappointed as I placed an order on 1st August following a flash 20% sale offer notification. The order total was £39 and then with a discount of £67 became £271. I had received a notification that my order would be delivered to a parcel shop as requested on Saturday 3rd August.
On the morning of Saturday 3rd August I received an email from DPD stating my parcel would not be delivered but instead would be sent back to ASOS and I should contact them for more information. I called ASOS at 8am to find out what happened, the advisor explained he was not ure but guessed usually in this instance the parcel was damaged in transit. He advised the money would be refunded to me once they received the items. I told him I did not want a refund just for them to send the items! He then explained unfortunately I would need to reorder these items. I asked about the great saving I had made, which was my reasoning for placing a large order and he explained ASOS were unable to guarantee I could get the 20% off again.
I was quite upset by this as none of this is my fault and I think it would be only fair that ASOS honour the discount I had given the delivery issue was nothing to do with me. He said he would put a note on the account. I then called back in the few hours later to find out if there was any update as to what did happen to my parcel. The advisor I spoke to this time kept me waiting for 10 minutes on the line whilst she contacted DPD to try and find out and speak to the depot. The advisor came back to me and informed me the parcel was too big for the parcel shop they were delivering to so it was being returned. On speaking with the depot she could try and get it redirected to my home address, but would need to send an email. She advised me once it had been picked up by the DPD depot I would receive an email regarding my order.

I waited for 4 hours and called back as I ahd not recived an email – of course, why would I expect a response. Where I have made complaints previously I have gotten responses from advisors repeating the same information and very unhelpful. On my 3rd call to ASOS on the afternoon of 3rd August I was told the DPD depot had not received the information in time and that it had been sent back to ASOS. I asked why was I not informed, again the advisor apologised. One apology after another. At this point I aked about the discount and can the order be replaced and I get the discount added over the phone and pay. I was told this could not be done and they would need to request a promotion code from the promotion team, which can take 48 hours for them to respond.
 It has now been 24 hours and I have not received any email to update me, though I will wait for 48 hours to pass – I am doubtful I will be contacted. How can one order be so much hassle. The fact that ASOS as a company cannot guarantee me the discount I originally had for an order that was messed up through no fault of my own is pretty poor.

Most retailers would apologise for the hassle and try and help, offer compensation or send you a discount code - but no...not ASOS!

Two hours on the live chat resulted in her passing it on to their specialist team, who would email me. Email response has been fairly quick, but each email has been from a new person and all of them completely useless.

Recently made a big purchase and qualified for the Free 2 day shipping. Waited and waited but no package arrived. I checked the status again and it was being sent back to the warehouse. While I contacted USPS to get it sorted out, they said the address was wrong therefore it will be sent back to ASOS. Before hanging up, I confirmed the address and it was correct.

Why is it being sent back without any communication from ASOS or shipping company? 
Now I am being told I won't get those items back and will have to reorder. 

The advise they gave is they will refund and if I still want them I'd need to re-purchase the items again. WT. F. Those items are not even available anymore. Why on earth would you run an online retail shop with bad shipping procurement and bad communication?!

Re-purchased same clothes in smaller size, but received one incorrect item.  Sent it back JUST like I did the last package not a week before, at the same post office.  A month later, no replacement no item.

Customer service REFUSES to even send the item I paid for.  I get why no refund without proof of shipping, but how about send me what I paid for!  If I had only received 3 items instead of 4, would you ask for proof is shipping? RIDICULOUS!!!

I don't care how cute their clothes are...NEVER AGAIN!

I am reporting them DIRECTLY to the US Federal Trade Commission!",1,ASOS,1

I took her bait, and purchased the dress and made her pay the two day shipping.  A dress came....it was foam like and black and white striped!!!!  Not even ROSE QUARTZ!  Can employees see??   Well... the dress is needed, and they won't refund or send the right dress until the other is back which can take up to 10 days.....

Candice Duarte,2019-03-25T19:35:17Z,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Charged custom fees on my REPLACEMENT. They sent me a faulty swimsuit with an oil stain. Resent a new one no problem but then when I asked about why am I getting charged custom fees AGAIN and if they can reimburse these fees the most they can do is refund you once the replacement is sent back to them. They also have no phone customer service everything is online. The quality of my swimsuit is garbage. The swimsuit isn’t even swim material. Not worth the price I paid. Not impressed. Dhl the carrier service said they get complaints from customers all the time with packages from ASOS and asking to refuse the package because they don’t want to pay customs on replacement.,1,ASOS,1

I contacted ASOS customer help multiple times, as always I got the most generic answers which were not helpful at all, plus probably the most rude customer support I've came across.

But this is sadly my last time doing any business with them.

I spent a little over $170 for 3 items and decided to  opt in the 3 day shipping l....WHAT A JOKE!!

First off when I placed my order I got an emailed  receipt stating my items would be here by the 29th..but as a few days rolled by I still hadn’t received any shipping information, by the 28th I was beyond annoyed that my items now just shipped 4 days after I ordered.

To top it all off my information now stated that they have till the 17th to get my items to me.. 

WHAT KIND OF BACK ALLY SHIPPING IS THIS!!

I have already messaged customer care twice and both times they said it was out of their hands once it went through the shipping process hahaha THANKS ASOS!!

I checked the tracking on my return and it says that it was received by them on January 9, so I don't understand why 1. I was not notified that they received it and 2. still have yet to see a refund almost 2 months later.

I tracked the package on February 27th knowing I was leaving out of town soon and it showed it was in Atlanta, GA and that it was going to be delivered March 4th. 

I reached out to customer care with screenshots and explained my situation hoping for help and was met with generic responses. Their solution is to wait until after March 1st. 

But if I wait until after that I will be left without my order- that I ordered knowing it would be delivered by then. It sounds dramatic but I feel helpless!

Brace yourselves for this LONG review:

I ordered my dress on 2/15 to ensure PLENTY of time for arrival as I have a trip coming up on 3/1. In order to be extra safe (so I thought), I decided to upgrade to 2 day shipping. As I was checking out I realized the ETA for my order was 2/26. HMMMM...definitely not 2 day shipping. Although bothered, I figured I'd rather pay extra for the ""2 day shipping""  and receive it 2/26 than take my chance with regular shipping. As the days passed I grew worried that my dress would not make it in time ESPECIALLY because I hadn't received any tracking information. I reached out to customer service, which was not the slightest bit of help. you will never receive a response from the same representative. Not only that, but they don't even read through your whole email and give faulty information. Anyway, I did not end up with tracking info until 2/23 (3 days before ETA.) It is now 2/28 and my package will not be arriving any time soon. Received an email today saying it will arrive on 3/7. LOL. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ASOS IF YOU NEED SPEEDY SHIPPING.",1,ASOS,1

Will have to wait almost 1 month for refund because they packed a Parcel Return Label for USPS for returns (which could take 2 weeks to arrive) and it takes 10 days after they receive to issue a credit/refund. Literally the refund and free shipping are already parts of their service as I didn't pay for shipping when I ordered the item. Customer service is unable to provide any retaining value.

Susan,2019-01-22T17:15:01Z,Worst company to order from,"ASOS has a obligation to give you, as a paying customer, an estimate cost of customs and duties when a product that you have ordered is being imported into Canada. I was charged $43.00 on a $94.00 dress, plus $15.00 shipping. I had NO idea it was going to cost $43.00 to import a cheap dress into Canada. I work with customs brokers every day, and there is no way it should cost that much. Just to recap: $53.00 to get a $94.00 dress across the border from the US to Canada. What's funny is that I do a lot of cross-border shopping, and it has NEVER cost that much for duties and taxes to import products into Canada. I'll never shop with them again. Absolute crooks. Even when I chatted with them to see what the deal was, they blamed it on Canada's import charges. Well that's bullsh*t. They should have the estimated cost of import duties listed before completing your order so you can make the choice if you want to order a cheap dress from ASOS, or a decent quality dress from somewhere else for less money. Shame on you ASOS. What a rip off. And the best part? You have to pay it all over again to return the item!

I'm shocked that their customer representatives would just completely ignore me on online chat and kept me waiting for 30min.

My husband ordered from Asos on the 30th pf July and paid almost 8 pounds for evening next day delivery (18:00-22:00). So today, 31st of July we were home waiting for the delivery. At 21:31 he received a text saying that the parcel has been delivered to our address and signed by my husband. Shocking!!!! Nobody knocked on our door!!!!! I went on live chat to asos. The lady who I was chatting was not helpful at all. I contacted the delivery company On the dot(subcontracted by city sprint). No answer!!!!! I called CitySprint. The robot said that the call is charging 7 POUNDS per minute. I was so angry and all I just wanted was soembody to pick up the phone to explain me what's going on. I spoke to an advisor. He wanted me to put me on hold while he was trying to call the courier. I told him not to take long because they are expensive and charging 7 pounds per minute. He was telling me that in no way they're charging that amount of money and that the robot is lieing. He said he will call me back. I waited 15 minutes and he didn't call me back. I called him back and he told me that he couldn't contact the driver that his phone is off. He transfered me to a department which whould be able to help me. I spoke with one guy who was saying that he can't help me. I am not playing when I am treated like this, when I am a customer I want to get what I paid for. I was told that the courier might have not been able to deliver it so my package was returned on the depot. He tried to call the courier...there was only voicemail. I asked him why do we pay a certain delivery method and we are not getting our package? He said he doesn't know. I asked him... if for any reason the courier is unable to deliver when it is supposed to deliver, why does he send text saying that the parcel has been delivered and signed for? He said he doesn't know. It is a joke. Please avoid at all costs!!!! Will never order from ASOS again as long as they use this useless courier company.

Possibly the rudest customer service I have ever received.

ASOS advertise prices in one place, then when you get the site you have to watch because the prices usually increase. e.g. advertised at £25 > click the link to go to the item > increases to £32.

ASOS told me they would honor prices when there are errors but they don't.
MEGAN their customer service rep, gave me a scripted response about it being the fault of my 'internet cookies'... bare in mind I am an IT Professional, but I humored her and tried it anyway. When I told her the problem still existed and explained this wouldn't fix it, she gave me another story about broken links.

When I could see she didn't have a clue what she was talking about, I asked to escalate to a manager/higher up. She said 'no I've already solved your issue' then ended the chat so I couldn't reply.
This is possibly the WORST customer service I have ever received from MEGAN at ASOS.

Also, hidden in their terms and conditions on some deep portion of their website, says that they recommend you receive a shipping receipt for returns because you are responsible for your items until they receive them.  This is not listed anywhere readily available to the consumer, including the multiple confirmation email(s) or the step by step return instructions on the shipping label. I spoke with Hannah from customer service who literally told me there was nothing she can do. Now I am out $230 and have no clothing or anything to show for it.

After emailing them 4 days after my parcel was due they told me it had been canceled because it was out of stock...all 4 items that I ordered apparently. After checking the website only 1 of the 4 things is actually out of stock. So basically they just couldn't be bothered to send the 3 items and refund one of them.
In the email process I told them I wanted some sort of compensation for messing me around for a week and adding to the stress of Christmas shopping as I now have to do it again. They gave me a 10% discount code as I had originally used one on my order...It was a student discount code that I use on every order to really it was a useless discount code.
Then to annoy me even more, I went to order the 3 items that were still in stock again and the £13 credit I used to buy it has not been refunded to my account despite telling me that it has been.

So, in the meantime I contact the parcel delivery company, ascertain my parcel has been deemed lost (after hours waiting in a queue, being told to wait 48 hours etc..) I then let ASOS know that Hermes have officially deemed it lost and told me to let the parcel sender know...

SO I now send an email saying, if its been confirmed lost can you do something? Emailed back saying, yes please provide proof. Send screenshot. 

Email back says, thanks for this but actually you are going to have to wait a week either way. (Each email is sent to a new person, so they are all saying different things). 

OKKKKK I wait until the week has passed - GREAT NOW CAN YOU LOOK INTO IT? Yes, thanks for your email - has been passed on to a specialist team, please wait 48 HOURS. 

Hear back from them - sorry, can't send new stuff for half your items as we are NOW OUT OF STOCK. YAY

Hayley Leonard,2019-01-19T14:14:28Z,Security tag left on my item,"I received my parcel and opened it to find the security tag had been left on my item of clothing. 

The item I purchased was a gift for my partners 30th Birthday which is on the 23rd Janruary! 

I’ve been on webchat for help, I’ve tweeted for help, I’ve sent messages on Facebook and still no lucky trying to sort this out. 

They want me to return the item before they send another one out but this means I will not have the item in time for Wednesday! 

I’m really unsatisfied with how the customer service team are handling my complaint, I’ve asked for compensation but they failed to respond to that part of my complaint. 

1/Customer service is rubbish.
2/They make it so difficult to speak to anyone.
3/They want me to go out of my way before helping me out. 

What a disappointing service I have received!",1,ASOS,1

Jessica ,2019-01-18T11:10:09Z,Dissappionted.,"I have ordered from ASOS a few times now and a part from a few late orders I’ve never had a problem. 
Earlier this month I made an order on this website and the estimated delivery was 12th January. On the 13th I tried to track my order due to it being late and it could not find it. I emailed and messaged them on Twitter to inform them. Finally on the 18th January I got my parcel in the post. But when I came to open it I realised it was not ge order I made. I informed ASOS right away to let them know I was dissappionted with this service. I received a reply to say I’d have to return this order and I would get a full refund but I would not get my correct order in return because they would have to look into this. 
I felt that I had to go out of my way to return this product for a mistake they had made. I will not be ordering from ASOS again.",1,ASOS,1

I needed an outfit for a Thursday, I bought the outfit Wednesday morning at 7am paid for same day delivery and with no warning was told at 10pm Wednesday night the outfit was going to arrive a day late rendering this purchase useless.

I contacted them on the online chat and was informed that despite the email the parcel was definitely going to be delivered. After 10pm I contacted them again and was informed that it would be delivered the next day and that the attempted delivery could have meant that the Van was broken rather then it being attempted at my address so I requested a refund for the delivery and was rejected! The guy says ‘regardless of wheather you care what the email said the delivery was attempted’ howeve 10 minutes before this he had informed me that the email could have just meant that the van had broken!!

Fin Bar,2018-12-09T07:21:35Z,Absolutely atrocious customer care from…,"Absolutely atrocious customer care from ASOS this morning. Had an issue with my website shopping bag malfunctioning and disappearing. The RESERVED item in my bag then showed out of stock after my bag emptied by itself, meaning it was either still reserved by the (now non-existent) malfunctioned bag or the reservation system was not working. Thinking I could find out if the item had actually sold or was just erroneously showing as still reserved and save myself waiting the 50 minutes to test if the item would unreserve/make sure it wasn't lost forever, I got in touch with two of their reps. I was misunderstood, ignored, and met with absolute incompetence over and over again. 

I suggested that the item was showing as out of stock because it was still linked to the malfunctioning bag, and may reappear when the 60 minute reservation window ended. I asked the ASOS reps to see if they could check this, but they were not able as they do not have access to sales or reservation information - how can a site provide competent service without this info? 

I then asked simply if it was possible for an item showing out of stock to do so because it's still reserved by me as my bag was still stored on the system somewhere, the customer reps failed to understand this theory, didn't have an answer for something surely so simple about the website's workings, refused to contact anyone else in their department for information or escalate to a manager, and fed me copy and paste responses/just plain fallacious information about the issue. The first rep ended the conversation abruptly before a solution was found. She also stated emphatically that there was no issue on their end and later suggested clearing my cookies despite the product showing as out of stock for her too, showing that she does not understand what cookies do. Both reps stated repeatedly 'as the item is out of stock there is nothing we can do', despite the fact that I had reserved it in my own bag! At no point did I feel heard or respected as a longstanding ASOS customer, I felt like I was dealing with uninformed, overwhelmed employees with absolutely zero ability to comprehend or assist in my issue. I was told I had lost the item due to an error and there's nothing else that could be done. I ended up waiting the 50 minutes, and it turned out that I was right to begin with: the item was held in reservation by my original bag and had become available again! How could ASOS not tell me this incredibly simple information? Had I listened to the customer service reps, I would've not bothered to wait and lost the item forever. How can you trust a website and shop with peace of mind if the reservation system doesn't work properly, and how can the employees not know the way this website feature works?

During this whole process, I complained about not being understood, and the ASOS reps continued to not be able to grasp the issue or escalate to anyone with sufficient understanding, it felt like they weren't properly reading my query or giving me any attentive care. I also asked for the complaints contact and was ignored twice.

I could purchase the item from ASOS, but I will be purchasing direct from the retailer instead. The bad service has dissuaded me from using ASOS in the future. 

Do not buy here if you want a company that respects and values you. They do not invest in customer service sufficiently, evidently, and if you have any issues you will not be treated well.",1,ASOS,1

You're now chatting to Harry
Alayssia Pringle
Hello Harry. My name is Alayssia. I placed an order yesterday 7/28 with a confirmation that the order would be in place by 8/1
Later to receive an email that 8/2. That is unacceptable I need the order 8/1
I have been disconnected from chat twice with no resolutions
I have been apologized to with no accommodation.
ASOS
Hi Alayssia, thanks for reaching out regarding your order 427265039. I'm sorry to hear your order will be delivered later than expected.
Alayssia Pringle
[02:23:26] Harry, what will be your creativity as apart of your mission statement to care for your customers need that your system glitched on.?!
ASOS
There's absolutely no way that the delivery date can be amended so you'll need to allow until the end of the day on 2nd August to receive it.
Alayssia Pringle
Can the order be re issued to ensure it is deliver by 8/1?
ASOS
If you place an order on Express, you can receive it by the 1st August 2019. 
Alayssia Pringle
Are you suggesting that I spend an additional 66 plus shipping after doing as instructed the 1st time
ASOS
This is the only alternative I can provide at this time.
Alayssia Pringle
So nothing is what you're offering?
ASOS
Yes.
Alayssia Pringle

Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you.   Your chat reference is 21494211.
Hi Alayssia, thanks for getting in touch.
I'll have a look.
Alayssia Pringle
Yes, please do.
ASOS
Thanks for waiting, I've checked and can see your order is being delivered by FedEx and is due to arrive by on or before the 2nd August 2019. If you haven't received your order by then, please get back in touch and we'll look into it for you.
Alayssia Pringle
Hi there
The order confirmation stated the 8/1 date that I referenced I was expected it to be delivered based on listing
I will be in NYC - 8/1 at 11AM, is there a way to reroute as the package is just been labeled and is sitting in ATL-GEORGIA
I will need this order no later than 8/1
I have confirmation that I was informed that it would be here by 8/1
or before
I do not have the funds to repurchase the items
ASOS
[14:15:00] I can see on the system the 2nd is the latest for the estimated delivery. I'll be unable to make any amendments to the order as it's passed the cancellation period. Your order can still arrive at anytime before as there may be a technical glitch with the tracking scans.
Alayssia Pringle
I have a screenshot of what was confirmed by the site not the shipping
Your site confirmed and spit out that date of 8/1
i sent the screen shot over last night 3 times
I will need my refund ASAP if this can not be fixed
I will not receive the package in TIME
ASOS
If you haven't received your refund by then, please let us know and we'll be able to sort that for you.
Alayssia Pringle
Refund is needed now
I will not need the purchase on the on Friday as I will be out of TOWN
how can you help with that?
 card information is updated and is on file
ASOS
As advised I'm unable to make any amendments to the order as it's already been processed. I've stated the order cab still arrive to you at anytime, if you haven't received it by then, I'll be able to help you further. This is what I have to abide by.
Alayssia Pringle
What about the mission statement of of CEO about being ""creative""
abide vs. going above and beyond
Please get me a manageer
at this point
Your mistake, my money, my loss
ASOS
Please re-frame from sending multiple messages as it's slowing the system down.
I have advised you what I have to follow, this is correct we're unable to proceed until the estimated delivery date has passed as your order can still arrive at anytime.
Alayssia Pringle
Ma am, are you serious? That has nothing to do with my purchase.
ASOS
It's slowing my responses to you Alayssia.
So as I've advised all I can, I'm going to close the chat. If you get in touch again you'll be advised the same information.
Have a good day.

Ben, I will need these items no later than Thursday.
I also have an overnight selection to make as well, will the technical difficulties interfere with this?

Can you do that for me?
ASOS
If you were to place an order using our next day delivery, it would arrive on the 31st July. We can't guarantee any delivery dates as there may be outside factors that contribute but we find delays are rare.
Alayssia Pringle
Ok. Thank you been. Worse case scenario Ben, what do we do about this shipment?
I can not stress the important of it being delivered no later than a Thursday August 1 listed on the email I sent.
Importance ^
ASOS
 Thanks for your patience. We've had a look and it looks like your order was placed after the cut off time which is why the estimated delivery date is the 2nd August. At this time, we won't be able to look into this further for you. This may arrive earlier than the 2nd so we would need you to allow for delivery to take place.
Alayssia Pringle
I can not do that Ben I need it to be in place by 8/1
What can we do to ensure that I am cared for
The screenshot sent says 8/1 Ben
ASOS
We won't be able to look into this further for you at this time. We will need to allow for the order to be delivered.
Alayssia Pringle
Ben, can you cancel the order and refund me so that I can pay additional for the overnight
The email I sent that you asked for says 8:1
ASOS
As the order has already been packed and is ready to go, we can't cancel and refund this for you.
Alayssia Pringle
It was asked of me to sent a screenshot I did so
You and I see that it says 8/1
How will this be accommodated I am not asking for a handout, refund so that I can ensure that I am cared for
I need those items by 8/1 Ben
Your confirmation says 8/1 now you're saying otherwise. I will ask that this be escalated now please
ASOS
As our system says the 2nd August, we will need to go by this date. As I mentioned, it may arrive sooner. However, at this time, we cannot do anything to look into this further for you. We will need to allow for the end of the day on the 2nd August before we can take a further look.
Alayssia Pringle
[What I sent says 8:1 what your screen shows and what my confirmation shows are very different.
You asked for proof and I delivered are you not delivering on what your confirmation says.
Where does it say, that after a certain time, delivery dates are subject to change?
Help me out here, I've done business with you all in the past and this is poor service.
If you can't help me get someone that can answer the questions I have. Please.
ASOS
[01:21:53] As the dates are differing, we will need to allow for the delivery to take place. I appreciate the importance of your order. However, at this time, there is nothing we can do to look into this as the order has been packed and is ready to go. We will need you to allow for the delivery to take place as this may well happen on the 1st.

Three weeks is quite unreasonable in my opinion, so I waited a week and explained that I didn't think this was fair. The last thing I wanted was for the order to be forgotten about. They told me I still needed to wait the full three weeks before contacting them again. Terrible customer service considering my order was already delayed.

The second agent said it was wrong, and I told her to double check because I was positive it was right! She told me to hold on and wait, and never came back.

Zhu Lin,2019-07-11T12:45:26Z,Simply awful service.,"Simply awful service.

I have to give one star, but I wouldn't even want to give them one star.

I have complained about my missing package and I cant get a straight answer from the company. First I was told to wait until after the 4th of July, when I then contact them again on the 5th of July, I'm being told to wait until after the 9th of July. Then i follow up on the 10th and I'm told to wait until the 16th, because all the multiple other advisers I spoke to before (which are at this point 5 plus advisers) have all given me incorrect information. I have requested a refund multiple times but I am told their hands are tied until after the 4th, after the 9th and now after the 16th. I have STILL not received my refund and they are refusing to act until after the 16th were I expect I will be told to wait until after probably the 20th or something. This is a total scam!

Not only are they not able to advise me, most of the advisers I spoke to were rude and passive aggressive. The reason I have had to go through so many advisers is that they keep closing the chat on me and changing adviser.

I would advise everyone not to use ASOS. I am myself prepared to launch an official complaint.",1,ASOS,1

Davorka Brajković,2019-07-10T17:59:11Z,Worst experience ever,"Worst experience ever! My last order never shipped and customer service wasn't helpful at all as they've only keep on repeating some robotic answers on my complaints about it. I'm still waiting and don't know the right reason why my order is still in their warehouse. Also, customer service was very rude, quitting chats without reason just because they don't have the right answer. Don't know what's wrong but something is really strange there! Guess I'll have to take some legal steps to resolve this situation.

UPDATE: They've contacted me yesterday and told me that my order was cancelled due to issues with their warehouse in Germany and that I have been refunded money back to my credit card (but I have to wait 5-10 working days for money to appear on my account).

I forgot to mention what have happened to me that day when I've placed my order from Asos. First I've tried to pay via PayPal (which I've done a couple of times before with no problems) but the checkout process wasn't successful and the page told me something like ""something went wrong, please check items in your bag"" and I've checked them, everything was there, so I've tried to pay again via PayPal but the same thing happened again. In that moment I've realised that something is really wrong and then I saw two e-mails from PayPal with same orders, but strangely - one calculated in euros and another one in pounds. After that I contacted Asos Customer Care via chat and told them what happened and they've told me that they are very sorry but they can't give me my money back right away and that I have to wait 5-10 working days to get my money back. Also, they've admitted that this was their fault as something went wrong on their page and that was the reason that I couldn't pay with PayPal. I've told them that I really want to buy those items and kindly ask them can they reserve those items for me and their answer was - NO. After that I ask them to give me money back right away and the answer was - NO. After that I've told them to handle my order manually as I paid for it twice and they've told me - NO. They really weren't interested to solve my problem and I've spoke to many members of Customer Care that day as they were quitting chats with me because I was trying to make them solve this problem. In the end, one person from Customer Care told me that the only way to buy those items was to pay for them with another payment method and because I really wanted those items I paid via credit card. After this debacle, my order never came and yesterday they've told me that they've refunded my money. So, I paid for my items and never get them. My balance on PayPal was the same that day when all of this happened so I didn't worry about it too much as in e-mails from PayPal was stated ""please note that this is not a charge, your account will be charged when the merchant processes your payment"", but yesterday I went to see something on my bank account and saw that this amount is still reserved, so I've contacted PayPal, also.

I usually receive my Asos order via courier with a tracking number. He told to me about postal delays in my area but after that he told me about the order being sent via courier. So after talking with him I have no idea if the order was sent via postal services or via courier or if it was really shipped. When I asked if the package left their deposit he just closed the chat in my face.
I hope I will receive this order but the new one will never happen from my side.",1,ASOS,1

One was processed in a timely manner, the other was not and when I inquired about this they kept saying ""wait 12 days.. wait another 12 days etc.. a member of our specialist team will get back to you"" and of course no one ever does. They also closed the chat window on me numerous times and said there is nothing they can do for me. How about investigate? I proceeded to reclaim my money through my credit card company and then funnily enough, my return was suddenly processed. I let me credit card company know that I finally received my money back. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I ever had. They send canned messages and provide no help or look into your account at all. I have a voucher to use at ASOS (that I wanted to use up and then be done with the company), but strangely every time I place an order, it gets cancelled. I think they banned me. All because I inquired about a lost/delayed return. Horrible company with unethical business practices. How they are still in business is very puzzling to me. I have been a loyal customer, spending thousands for nearly a decade and this is how they treated me.",1,ASOS,1

Despite this, the parcel was delivered to the old address and I had to waste time and money on travel to collect it myself! When speaking to a member of customer services called Callum, I was made to feel stupid, even though I am 1000% sure it was not my error on either of the occasions. I have always been a loyal customer, but I am more than disappointed, especially at how customer services have treated me, completely dismissing my query (despite explaining very thoroughly that there was NO WAY that my device inputted the wrong address since it is not saved on it). I even did some searching online and other people have had the EXACT same issue. Still, I was met with a blatantly copied and pasted response from above stating that it was not their fault, and therefore implying that I am either lying or simply stupid.

Ordered from Asos for the first time last week. 2 white dresses (getting married on the beach in september). Received my order. One of the dresses i recieved is wrong, however worked to my advantage because i love it. The dress i should have had was £60 the dress they sent was £44. All i wanted from them was the £16 difference back. (I know its not much but its not the point). I was very happy to keep the wrong dress and just be refunded the difference. However they will not do it and require me to send the wrong item back for a full refund. Now if i could have ordered this item again then that would have been no problem, however this dress is out of stock online therefore id send it back to never be able to order it again. 
Will be keeping the wrong dress as its perfect but will not be ordering from here again. 
Not only did they send me the wrong order in the first place but they've gained extra money from me, custome service was appauling, i must have repeated my self numerous times, only to be told the same thing over and over again, very poor understanding and listening skills ASOS and unwillingness to help a customer.",1,ASOS,1

I passed my package off to my mailman (so I did not receive a receipt) and three weeks later here I am waiting for a refund. I contacted them and they pretty much told me we need to see the receipt. My question to them, do you not keep track of the labels that you issue to your customers where you can pull it up? Their response, it's a free label, you need to get a receipt. Okayyyy. Well some people can't go to the post office and get a receipt. I asked to speak to a manager and they told me that they would say the same thing to me and ended the chat immediately.

CJD,2019-06-21T14:20:04Z,DISGUSTING Customer Service on Facebook,"I ordered a dress from ASOS for a wedding in 2 days. The dress arrived the next day and was infact not the dress I ordered. This was a completely different style and colour.
I immediately contacted them to see if anything could be done for me as the wedding was now tomorrow and I had no outfit. I explained I will post it back to them and show proof of postage, but they refused to post a new one out to me so I could have something to wear.
Customer service on Facebook was terrible! In the space of an hour, I had spoken to 4 different employees, all of whom told me to post the dress back and wait for a refund to be processed. No compassion or consideration for my situation in the slightest.

I then requested to be compensated with a discount code as I would now need to purchase a new dress for tomorrow and pay for next day delivery again, only to be told I couldn't have one. 

Luckily I called them rather than dealing with the imbecile's on Facebook chat, and I spoke to a lovely gent who was shocked at the appalling approach the staff had on social media. He immediately gave me a 15% discount code to use when I wish and refunded the next day delivery to me.

Think the staff who deal with Facebook chat need re-training and an attitude adjustment. They still havent replied to my last message which I sent 4 weeks ago aha!",1,ASOS,1

But this was really the final straw. I ordered a Lacoste hoodie, blue size small. It turned up and was a large! Under the consumer rights act, it broke almost every assurance. My first day delivery was negligible as I had to wait over a week for a refund, I could no longer use my 20% universal or 25% student code (as every person has limited finances) and the ASOS team refuse to allow you to speak to anyone over a phone. All of their responses via messenger are automated and their customer care team doesn’t even reply to email complaints.

Appalling service from a disorganised company. No wonder they’ve had 2 warehouse fires, with this lack of planning.

Kulsum ,2019-06-21T12:01:10Z,Terrible Customer Service!,"Hi,

I have been a loyal customer to Asos for over 4 years now and have recently been experiences issues with a delay in delivery. I understand and am well aware that deliveries are of no fault of the company and understand that some circumstances are unforseen. However, when sharing my concern and complaints to Asos about a delivery which had been 4 days late (having paid for a yearly subscription of £9.99), their simple response was they could not do anything about it and rather I should wait until an additional 4 days maximum to receive me order. The team were well aware that they had put me at great inconvenience however, were adamant they could do nothing to compensate for the inconvenience they had caused. 

This is a re occuring issue I have been facing with Asos recently, and as a former loyal customer to them advise you buy your item else where as the customer service you will receive is likely to be much better. 

Kind regards.",1,ASOS,1

Apparently, my refund will occur in 5-7 days but I'm worried that they will even follow through with that after this horrible experience.  I explained to the associate, Adam,  that I would be writing negative reviews and he really did not seem to care, only stating that he'd be happy to pass the feedback along and that I could close the chat if I was done.

This is something that trust-pilot should have looked into. This company won't make any customers to be satisfied. I guess all the good reviews are just made up not from real customers. If they think their service is good enough, why refused to answer the question about refunding shipping fee.

I understood if they weren't refunding for the two ugly ones, since I supposedly had overlooked the T&C for the promotion I used. But they refused to refund for their mistake too, continuously citing ""T&C"". That's complete bs. I didn't get what I ordered. That should be grounds enough for a refund. But no. 

They phrase their sly T&C in a way that covers their a** when they make a mistake too. So now I lost my items, lost money, and completely lost faith in a company I've been supporting for 6 years now.

I have placed orders on several items from you within the last few weeks. So far I have only received one package, 3 weeks after it was scheduled to be here. Upon opening the package I discovered that the orders were wrong. Ordered a calvin klein TOTE and PAID for a tote and instead got a cross body bag which I'm sure is of much less value!! Clothes are so pathetically small, it wouldn't fit a tooth pick, and I am a very petite woman so that says a lot! Unwearable unless I lose 10kg!! 
I ordered gold clips and got silver. 

I am dreading the arrival of my other packages as I'm certain they too will be a disappointment. I live in South Africa so the nightmare of trying to return these items won't be worth the headache. Not that I can even get hold of anyone in customer service! 

Keep it up, ASOS. At this rate you will be a flash in the pan company who won't exist in a year! Your clothes look beautiful on the website, the prices seem fair, I would have continued to be a loyal customer if my experience had been different but I will never again support your organisation. 

Quick to take the money but no attention to detail on customer orders and no customer service either.

After this I’ve grown fed up and have complained to Asos after a parcel I had ordered didn’t turn up. I had no notification of delays and asos’s Customer care was bloody shocking.

I think the good reviews are in case you don’t get in touch with any support function - if the order leaves on time and everything is in good condition. Otherwise, good luck speaking with anyone from there.

Via 10 emails they gave me the same answer over and over again. Besides, they don’t even know how transportation work, who does deliveries until midnight?? (They couldn’t look into my order until midnight, as they are under the impression transport will happen after 8pm... )

Stephanie Murphy,2018-11-04T12:36:33Z,Products stolen from order and no help,"I ordered a lot of make up through you (roughly £100 worth) and it never arrived in my parcel. I provided photos showing that the parcel had been opened and then resealed by DPD but you still haven’t helped refund me or resend me the items. Originally you said you would come back to me after 5 working days, I then followed up and on the 5th working day and you said to leave it to the next day. I’ve now followed up every single day since then and you keep repasting the same message stating you’ll let me know when there’s an update. It’s now been nearly 2 weeks since I notified you of this and it’s really frustrating that you’re not sticking to your own deadlines or trying to help me in anyway at all. Typically I would expect with good customer service that you would refund or replace the items and then you can follow up with your partner DPD rather than waiting for a response from them before helping your customer. I regularly buy from ASOS and have been a customer for a number of years and I feel your level of service has significantly decreased over the last couple of years. I now find it very unreliable and also unhelpful when there’s a problem and would now find myself questioning whether I would recommend using your company due to the lack of care if anything goes wrong. I hope that I will receive some kind of suitable resolution to my recent order but to anyone reading this please think twice about whether you want to order from ASOS as this is not the only time this has happened.",1,ASOS,1

stacey Pitt,2019-06-19T19:48:07Z,ASOS refused to give me a refund and blocked my account for apparent suspicious activity!!,"I ordered many products recently due to having a wedding and a two-day concert happening within a few weeks of each other. I find actually going out shopping quite stressful, therefore I purchase things online, try them on and send them back if I don’t like them or they are no good. I have never had issues with this until recently with ASOS
I made a few purchases recently at ASOS, Boohoo, Misguided and New Look for recent events. ASOS offer payment through Klarna , which is amazing due to being able to try clothes on and pay for the ones you like within 28 days, therefore saves paying off your card and waiting for a refund if not liked. Due to events fast approaching and not finding an outfit I liked, I decided to make a large order with ASOS to try on things which I hadn’t thought of previously. I also ordered things in both an 8 and a 10 due to sizes varying and having the size required if I finally found something I liked. Anyway, I ended up spending £399 and was sad to find that only a hat suited me out of the products I had purchased. I was fortunate enough to have liked items I had purchased from Boohoo on my card around the same time. 
I packaged my parcel up with everything barring the hat which I loved. I then attached the pre-printed labels and returned my parcel as I always do. I didn’t think anything of this until 19 days later I found on Klarna that I was still outstanding the full ASOS balance of £399. Shocked at this, I contacted ASOS who stated they hadn’t received my return.  They requested proof of sending. I initially thought I had sent this on the 28th May due to having a tracking system on my phone which showed that I stopped off at the post office on this date. I was able to locate a post office return receipt from the 24th May to ASOS following upturning my house and sent this in a proof of return. I was then informed that I said I previously informed them it was the 28th May I returned. I informed staff that I had sent many things back recently, therefore was mistaken and have proof that my ASOS parcel was returned on 24th May and was received by their depot.  I was informed that this would have to be passed onto the customer care team and would receive a reply within the next 24 hours. 
Almost 36 hours later I was sent and email from the customer care team to which completely shocked me. 
“After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for the return of order 410563118. It’s very rare for returns to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response”.
So ASOS have apparently looked into my account and have suspected suspicious activity.  I have contacted various people from ASOS to which I have had people ignore me, put the phone down or basically make me feel like a criminal. Apparently, it is suspicious because I have made a few large purchases recently and sent most if not all of my order back due to not liking them. Having the option of Klarna, I have taken advantage of being able to make purchases and only pay for the ones I like and return the others without having to pay. Apparently, this is suspicious? Why I ask? Anyway, ASOS must think I still have my parcel despite informing them I don’t and have evidence of postage which confirmed they had received it. 
I am completely blocked from my ASOS account and will be unable to make any future orders (not that I would now) and have no way of discussing this case further with them.  I have made many orders with ASOS and have had no previous suspicious activity on my account. I have no criminal record. I have no bad reputation. I am a registered and respected mental health nurse working in the NHS. I have also never had any problems with any other shopping company. So it’s safe to say that I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the unprofessionalism and poor customer service that I have received from ASOS. I would be happy to remove my post should this be rectified by ASOS, however my opinion will always be negative of ASOS going forward should this not be resolved. I have also paid my £10 delivery saver and would like this refunding due to being unable to take advantage of this in the future.

You are supposed to receive an email within 10 business days that your item has been received and an refund is being issued to your account. Its been 15 business days and my package has not been received yet. 

I have contacted customer care multiple times and they copy and paste the same message. They require proof of postage to look into this, although the other forms of proof of postage they require are included in the package that was sent back. I have voiced my concerns through their livechat and it always goes back to “you need proof of postage.” Which I explained I do not have. I asked this one person who was working the live chat a question, and her response was “now I see I have answered all your questions, I’m going to go ahead and end this chat.” and closed the chat 

So I started emailing. I have been passed on to different people and eventually asked if I could set up a phone call with them (because they don’t have a call center!) They said yes and asked me when. I told them the day and time I’m free, which was today, and I have not received a phone call from them. Instead, yesterday I received an email from a different member of customer service saying they were looking into this and will get back to me soon-still haven’t heard anything.

I’m £100 out of pocket and spent the day really upset at the tone of their email (accusing me of fraud)

Handed return package to mail man and apparently I needed a receipt of some sort to show proof of shipment after discovering that the package hasn’t even left the states after 2 weeks of me handing the package over. They have no serial number on these prepaid labels so my package got lost somehow due to a failure in establishing an “activated” shipment and I only have my name and return address to work with in attempts towards locating the thing at the Post Office. I’m sure once I locate it it will also conveniently fall beyond the return date deadline since being MIA.

Denis,2019-01-06T21:02:33Z,Dont buy from this company!!!!,"Dear all,

Please read the review before you buy something on Asos.
I bough some staff there on Nov 18.I supposed to get my staff by Dec 6 how it was said on my account.
From Dec 6 i checked my post office almost every day and didn't get anything.
I called them as well yesterday, nothing.
Asos, you support team is terrible.They told me to wait till Dec 26.I waited.
Then again wait, wait.Then i said that i needed my money back, they said check you custom office and so on....Just wasting time.Then they made their investigation and off course they were right and not responsible for anything.

Guys, even when i buy some staff from China, they give my a track number even if i pay $10, i can track my order.You - nothing.No track number for free delivery.Common.....

I've sent a request for charge back....

People, don't buy from them.......

It now says DPD hasn't received my order but my delivery will be sent at time requested! Well I'm still waiting! Shocking service! No wonder why you're rated 1 star

Contacted a customer service agent at asos called Rajintha and he/she was outright rude, all he kept saying was you will have to wait until midnight for your delivery even tho I paid 5.95 for next day and a specific time slot! I'm not waiting up until midnight for a delivery I have work early. Shocking service and rude! Also said that I wont get a refund for the delivery service I Paid for! I will be getting a refund as I didn't get the service I PAID for!

*UPDATE*
Been in contact with DPD and they say Asos didn't even send the parcel to them for shipping!

I keep getting a scripted reply from each associate that I need to check with my neighbours and call my local post office to see if it is there.I called Canada post they literally told me without a tracking number they can do nothing. I contacted them back and they told me if it does not arrive by June 23 to get back to them. Told me they are an online company and no managers to speak to. I asked for someone to call me and they refused. At this point I am thinking my dress is not coming and going to be contacting my credit card company in hopes of a refund. I will never and I mean never order from this company again. I’m not sure what’s happened but I’ve ordered about two years ago and never had an issue.

I have encountered various issues with the orders I've placed over the past year, from damaged hair wax leaking all over other items, to jeans appearing completely different to how they look online and next day delivery orders not being honoured.

On each occasion, they seem incapable of viewing the circumstance from the customer's perspective. The most recent example - that of the hair wax - is the one which tipped me over the edge. Despite two other items being damaged, they have refused to refund them as it was ""only the wax which was faulty"". All customer queries go through the ridiculous 'Gnatta' online chat system, meaning you cannot have a proper conversation with anybody. There is no telephone number or written address available, and if you ask to escalate a complaint or speak to a supervisor you will be told ""all complaints are reviewed and dealt with alternatively"". It is all designed to protect the company rather than help the customer, and to deflect and ignore complaints as much as they possibly can.

The products and prices are good but if you ever have a problem with an order (which for me have become increasingly frequent) then you'll never want to shop there again.",1,ASOS,2

The day after the CONFIRMED delivery date I receive a dispatch email! Unbelievable! 

Again carrier does not give me a timeslot so like a complete moron (maybe ASOS will give me a job) I contact “customer service” again and am now told to wait a further THREE DAYS for my next day delivery. 

Absolutely shoddy service from clueless staff. I can’t even cancel apparently as it’s with the carrier (how that is my issue I do not know)

NS,2019-12-14T00:04:45Z,Misleading exchange,"I ordered a variety of items from asos on 29/11/19 and recieved my delivery on 09/12/19. I kept the items that were suitable. 4 items were sent back on 10/12/19 at 13:47. 3 items had been selected for a refund and 1 was requested for an exchange. I recieved an email today at 16:57 stating all of the items had been refunded, which I did not want. I first attempted contact around 7pm but had no luck. I recontacted Asos at 23:08 explaining the occurrence to the unhelpful Marta. I was given this - 'I’ve had a look and can see that we still have the jacket in stock – I’m sorry we weren’t able to replace this for you. It could be that none were available when we went to replace your order, which is why we weren’t able to replace it for you' then this 'as the refund has already been accepted by your bank, we're unable to send a replacement.The refund was processed on 13th December. Please allow up to 10 working days for the money to appear in your account. If you'd like, you could place a new order for the jacket and I'll refund your delivery charge. After you've received your shipping confirmation email, just reply to this email with your new order number - and we'll arrange your refund.' I think offering me free delivery was a terrible option, considering it is a mistake on their part. I mentioned I didn't see why I should be paying the now full price for an item where I had asked for it to be exchanged when it was a mistake on their part. Along with wondering if they had my form to view this error on their end. I got offered a 20% voucher, still not good enough when the item was 30% less and I didn't make an error they did. I opted for their exchange service which they have not honoured. I was then given another sad response 'We would only be able to offer a 20% code. The jacket could have been out of stock at the time, in which scenario we would refund you, but may have come back into stock.
I'm not able to get your form, this would be at our warehouse.' The availability of this item in the size I have wanted has consistently been available every day since I sent the item back as that is what the website is still currently showing. I asked for this to be escalated as the outcome was not satisfying as I reiterate they have made the error. I was told it would not be escalated as the sales have ended. What does that matter? An escalation was my request. What I was finally left with... 'I completely understand, however the refund has been accepted by your bank and the price has changed so all I could offer is a 20% goodwill gesture.
*my response*
[23:25:49] What u are offering isn't enough
[23:25:57] I didnt ask for a refund
ASOS
[23:26:10] As I'm not able to help further and I've already given you a 20% promo code, I'll close the chat.

I think this is a real sign of a company trying to manipulate you to spend more on an item they offer exchanges regardless of being bought in the sale. The mistake is from their end and I am clearly being fobbed off with a good will gesture than a solution. Avoiding this being escalated is truly unprofessional.",1,ASOS,2

I received an update today to say that my parcel that was out of stock has now been delivered... no parcel?! For the guy to then turn around and say my refund was never even placed!!! So angry at this company and has anyone contacted me to apologise... nope. So very disappointed in this service.

Never had any problems with them until 3 weeks ago when I received an order with 3 pairs of trainers missing, I contacted them and they gave me a refund. Then few days later I placed another order for some trainers again wich I never received ! Something with Asos and DPD, once again they refunded me. Once again I placed another order for another pair of trainers, and I received a beanie instead !🤦🏻‍♀️ i thought ok I’ll give them one more chance, ordered trainers again and a pair of ugg boots and some jeans. Received everything but the two pairs of shoes. Had to contact them again and now they blocked my account, banned me from buying from them and wants me to pay for the missing shoes ! Are you freaking kidding me Asos! Something is definitely wrong with their warehouse since November but instead of finding what is happening they blame the customer ! Do Not Buy From Them !",1,ASOS,2
Mr David Clayden,2019-12-17T21:38:30Z,no response or option to change,Needed to change my delivery address but was unable to do so. Contacted ASOS three times with no response and my order was returned back to them without me being given the option to change a delivery address with the courier. As a result the Black Friday discount has been and gone if I place a reorder this will no longer be available. There was no need for the items to be returned to ASOS I simply needed to be able to change my address. Not quite sure how such a big company can not even respond to 2 emails and their Facebook messenger or have a courier service that doesn’t allow you to redirect your order. A token 15% discount has been given on a future order but that won’t match what I originally ordered. Non existent customer service and an inadequate solution provided,1,ASOS,2

I know this sounds absurd...but I literally captured it on camera, and instead of my boots, I received a WORN IN, USED shirt with HAIR on it, and I also received new children's pants...like what?! I have returned my items for a refund because ASOS customer service denied me any compensation or anything for their mistake and instead, didn't refund me on shipping, made me go through this whole process...even though I received completely the incorrect order. Honestly, I contacted them on every platform and their response rates were awful, and they were rude as well. I have never been treated so poorly by a company. I had fine experiences with ASOS before, so I thought I could trust them...but this one AWFUL experience outweighs them all. please please dont trust ASOS.

Ky ,2019-12-18T14:35:02Z,BOYCOTT ASOS!!!,"IF ANYONE IS ABOUT TO ORDER ON ASOS DELIVERY FOR CHRISTMAS DONT DO IT!!!! ITS A SCAM!! 
What ASOS fail to tell you is that if you do a next day delivery and it does not show up, they cannot investigate until 4 DAYS passed your delivery due date!! As that is there contract with the couriers! You most probably won’t get your delivery before Christmas! ASOS will not do anything until then! In fact ASOS state that they allow those 4 extra days for the courier to deliver it. So why are YOU(ASOS) making  false promises on your website???? ALSO for everyone to know, IF you do a STANDARD delivery which is what I did, and it does not turn up on the day of delivery, they will  won’t investigate it until 7 DAYS AFTER THE DELIVERY DATE as they allow an extra 7 days for the courier to deliver!!!! 
SO PLEASE, DO NOT ORDER THINGS FROM ASOS IF YOU REALLY NEED SOMETHING BY A CERTAIN DATE AS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL COME. WHEN IT DOESNT THAT WONT INVESTIGATE IT UNTIL 4-7 DAYS PASS! ASOS website is very misleading!! ASOS YOU NEED TO POST THIS ON YOUR WEBSITE BECAUSE YOUR OUT HERE RUINING PEOPLES LIVES & CHRISTMAS PRESENTS!!! Your quick to take our hard earned money but can not deliver what you advertise!!! THE COURIER IN PARTICULAR I AM REFERRING TO IS HERMES!!! THEY ARE ABSOLUTE CRUD!!! FIND A REPLACEMENT ASAPPPP!!! THE NEVER DELIVER ON TIME!! ALWAYS DAYS TO WEEKS LATER!!! SORT IT OUT ASOS!!!!! & TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!!!!! YOU SIGNED UP HERMES DON’T RUN AWAY FROM THIS!!!!
If you don’t mind waiting weeks/months for something the go ahead and order from ASOS, BUT if not don’t waste your time with ASOS!! Don’t waste your money paying £9.95 for the year either as that does not work either! ASOS do not take responsibility for their orders they just care about taking your money. TOTAL SCAMMERS!!!

IT THEN GETS WORSE!! MY DELIVERY FINALLY SHOWED UP THREE DAYS LATER, AND THEN IT HAS TWO ITEMS MISSING IN IT!!! THESE PEOPLE TAKE THE LIVING MICK!!!! THEN THEY TELL ME THEY CANT ORDER A REPLACEMENT FOR 48HRS & EVEN THEN IT WILL BE ON SUPPOSED NEXT DAY DELIVERY SO PLUS ANOTHER 24HRS!! I WONT BE SEEING THESE THINGS UNTIL NEXT WEEK!!! MY CHRISTMAS PRESENTS ARE RUINED!!! DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME ON ASOS!!! THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!! ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS TAKING YOUR MONEY!!!",1,ASOS,2

Spoke with Claudia at customer services and was told there's nothing they can do. She can't contact Hermes to find out the status of my order but they do have it, they just haven't scanned it yet. ""Hopefully"" it will arrive on the 23rd but there's no guarantees now, they might scan it today... Today is a Sunday. Hopefully isn't the answer I'm looking for, I appreciate Xmas is a busy period but I need this present to arrive on time or the ability to cancel and receive a refund so I can purchase a new gift elsewhere. Amazon and other have managed last minute (18th) orders fine. Claudia explained she's done all she can to help and promptly closed the chat.

I have a concierge in my building there 8 - 8 7 days a week and I have been working from home to take the delivery and there is no way that they even bothered to try and deliver because neither myself nor the concierge were contacted.

Surely a popper is supposed to be used and sewn strong enough to handle that for more than 3 wears? I was told there was nothing they could do and they trust their warehouse staff to get it right (because obviously humans never make mistakes) basically insinuating that I am lying. This was the final straw and they have now lost a customer.

The item was set to arrive the 21st of december. The 20th of december I recieve a notification, that the parcel Will be a bit late - max one working day. 

However, even the 21st of december the order was not marked as shipped, so I became suspicious - the parcel could in no Way reach Denmark the same Day it was shipped. After trying to get in contact with your customerservice 4 times, finally I reach you via your chat function. Your employee looks into the matter and informs me that: 
 I was notified by e-mail that they made a mistake and the item was out of Stock. This e-mail should I have recieved the 21st of december. 

But I dont Think you ever sent that e-mail: It is not in my inbox, nor in my spam filter and the order has been marked as recieved until this moment - if you had notified my, Why would you not cancel the order in your own system as Well? It does not make sense. Fuethermore, when checking in your track your order it Said that the parcel was shipped from your warehouse - that seems impossible if you dont have it. 

You leave with a terrible experience of your service: If the item was not in Stock, Why would you wait notifying me until 7-8 days after the purchase? And Why on earth would you charge me for a product you dont even have?

You almost have to anticipate they'll make mistakes in your order and somehow foolproof it by buying multiple sizes and returning them because you can ABSOLUTELY TRUST that they will put their business above your needs as a customer. No point telling their support team as they have a script that they won't budge away from. Expect to talk to a recorded message. Apparently by saying ""I'm sorry"" and ""I understand"", it makes it 'personalised'.

Main message: if THEY make a mistake on your order, expect to cop the loss. Their size and popularity makes them believe they're above reproach. Vote with your money guys. There is no buyer guarantee here.",1,ASOS,2

I was told at one point that the matter was being referred to a “specialist team” I have yet to hear from them.

Despite chasing ASOS repeatedly to question what happened, everything was selling out. 

After having their iT team look into it, it started working yesterday - Tuesday. When everything I wanted was out of stock. How very convenient. 

I am now incredibly disappointed to see you’ve started charging me from the day I ordered it despite not being able to use it. I asked for the start date to be amended to yesterday and not the 11th Nov as it’s an error with the company that I haven’t been able to do so.

It was supposed to be a next day delivery, after placing my order I was told it would arrive on Sunday (not saturday). I appriciate that I may have missed the cut off deadline, and was happy to recieve a dispatch notice on saturday night, say it would be delivered on sunday. 
Sunday however, my parcel did not arrive, so on Monday I got in touch via live chat to a member of staff called Paige. I explained that my works do was that day (monday), that my parcel was missing with my outfits in, and that I had no idea when I was to expect them. I was told I would have to wait until the 12th. Which was 5 days over due. I explained I wanted to complain, and escalate this issue, but was told there was no way to do so, and that the live chat would be used to take feedback on board. I asked to be notified with a follow up regarding my complaint, and was told that wasn't possible. I was told there was no contact details for complaints, no form and no way to highlight my issues other than in my live chat with Paige.
Today,  I arrived home to a note from hermes saying that they had tried to deliver my parcel, it was the last attempt and that I would have to get back in touch with the seller. Which I did this evening. I was on live chat with Lisa (refrence for chat: 24411465) for nearly an hour. The collegue I spoke to repeatedly ignored what I was trying to explain in my messages, and just continued to repeat that hermes will try and deliver tomorrow, and if they don't I am to get in touch.I asked several times if I could just cancel the order, as that is what had happened last time my bridesmaid dresses had gone missing in September. I was told no. 
I asked for a complaints contact link, as this issue has cause me so much stress. This time I was sent the relevant link to highlight my concerns. 
I've been told that I now have to wait to see if hermes will deliver tomorrow, if not I'm to get in touch again. 
I would implore you to encourage your staff to know company policies eg links to a feedback form, contact details and a customers right to highlight concerns and issues. I have now had several isses with asos, and each time I try and believe its an anomaly. On other occasions ASOS staff have been so helpful, however this time, I just felt like I was pushed from pillar to post, and lied to repeatedly.

I called customer services and, no matter what I said, the person just kept repeating that they were busy and the information on delivery delays was on the website and then hung up on me! These delays seem to happen every time there is a busy period, like Black Friday or Xmas, yet they fail each and every time to anticipate demand! I must say, though, that two weeks for delivery of a pair of Aldo boots is definitely a record!

I placed 3 orders using Klarna, all of which sadly included either faulty/incorrect items. I’ve been unwell so my return was late, only by a few days, however it did not even cross my mind that this would be an issue since my orders were incorrect/faulty.

ASOS have issued gift vouchers for the orders- when I raised my concern I was told that it would be passed to a “specialist team”. Almost a week later I had to chase them for a response, to which I was told “these orders will be refunded by 5th December”. I thought that the issue was resolved.

The next day I was told that the previous person informed me incorrectly and that NO refunds are being issued.

Consumer rights act 2015 states that BY LAW a customer can return incorrect/faulty orders, or items that are generally not fit for purpose within 6 months of receiving them. 
ASOS appear to be convinced that they are above consumer law and almost 2 weeks on they are still trying to bully me into backing down. It’s shocking to think how many customers they have done this to who probably have backed down because they’ve not been aware of their rights.

If you ever need to contact them about an order that's been processed, it's basically pointless because the wear-house and customer service team seem to be totally independent so there's no direct line of communication.

Whenever I am logged into my account and try and chat with customer service, they won't deal with my query because it shows on their system that I am logged in with an old email address so doesn't match my account, which is a glitch in their system, I have emailed and raised this about six times over the two last year and I've not heard a single thing. Whenever I contact them I need to hope whoever I am talking to isn't going too brother going through security, which happens from time to time. 

This past week I ordered a pair of boots, received a completely wrong pair, had to return them to wait over a week for them to be re-dispatched and I just got an email telling me you're sending a replacement but in a size 7. So, by the time these replacements get sent back and I receive the correct pair (I am really not confident I will even get the right pair) that will be over the two week mark. Fantastic.",1,ASOS,2

If you want a taste of the ASOS 'customer service' experience see this barely literate response to a query regarding a delayed order. Considering I pay the annual fee for next day delivery this is very poor. Companies always try to pass the buck on failed deliveries, but my contract is with ASOS, and not the carrier company. Useless.

sorry that your order hasn't came in time but unfortunately i cant do anything as i cant get in contact with hermes regarding delivery or returns, if needing help seeing where your order is you could track your order number on the hermes tracking site, or get in contact with hermes",1,ASOS,2

Shopped at ASOS for years, pay for a next day delivery pass every year and order nearly every month - in my last order i received TWO faulty items that were unwearable - when i contacted customer service they said the only thing they could do is for me to repackage it all and return it, wait for them to decide if the item was faulty or not, and then i would potentially recieve a refund. The items were out of stock so i did not want to do this. They said i could take the items to a repair shop, get a quote from them, then go back to Asos and give them a certified quote and wait for them to decide if they wanted to pay for it or not. ABSOLUTE joke for me to have to pull out all the stops when they have sent faulty items that i paid for.

However, ASOS applies all discount codes before taxes are added making the discount code useless because the taxes dump on the resently applied discount + more, there has been times where my discount has been $12, however taxes added $17, again, making the discount codes useless.

Nothing arrives by Nov. 15th, no delivery updates whatsoever since dispatch. I contact ""customer care online"" on the 15th. Told to wait until end of the day before they can investigate or do more. Following day I contact again and told I'm told to contact local postal service here yet no delivery reference numbers supplied are valid even though ASOS tell me the items are in Vietnam and they have no way of tracking??? I contact VietnamPost to no avail, no numbers for delivery valid. Yet again contact ASOS and now told to check they haven't left items outside, under something or another neighbor has??? The items would need to be signed for surely but then again we are talking about a company who clearly has no idea what's going on with their courier delivery services overseas! Next? Tell me to wait until December 9th before they can do anything more??? 

Their customer care team is attrocious. they only read pre-prepared scripts to copy and paste onto your valid, concerned enquiries. To make matters worse they then spout rubbish  and palm you off. I'm now expected to wait until Dec.9th as they must be bringing said items ordered by bicycle I think! So...they use a courier service to deliver to another country and then can't track it? This is 2019 and if that's the case (obviously) then why even offer a worldwide delivery ""service"" by chance at all? For such a well established company I find their excuses, lack of help and worse, no way of finding my order, truly unbelievable and to somehow then expect a customer to wait 42 days before you will do anything further is wholly unacceptable. If you live overseas in South East Asia DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS as they do not track their deliveries after departing the UK and your tracking numbers are not valid in any foreign country you are presently residing.

After repeatedly outlining what happened to ASOS, and ASOS repeatedly asking me the same questions, over and over again, their conclusion is that is that it's not ASOS' responsibility to deliver their parcels successfully to the customer's address.

I have been a repeat customer of Asos for years and never had any issues until recently. I placed a large order for items from Asos as I was going away on holiday however the parcel never arrived. I contacted Asos customer services as according to the tracking information it had been delivered and left in the porch, which I thought was very careless being as the sum of the parcel was £1600. I have never stated that my parcels can be left within an area of my building other than being given to myself with my signature.
After providing my information Asos stated that DPD have left the parcel in a safe place (front porch) and will be closing the case without refunding me. I have asked for photographs of the location in which this was left as they have managed to lose a very expensive parcel without providing me with any information or receiving a signature. When Asos emailed me back it was with another customer care representative who stated that DPD left the parcel with a neighbor but did not state which one. I again emailed back complaining that I would like my money refunding as none of my neighbors have received a parcel on my behalf. I was then emailed by again another different customer care representative who stated that DPD had spoken to a neighbor and left the parcel in a safe place but are yet to provide with any supportive evidence this was actually completed. Throughout this whole ordeal I have spoken to many various employees of the ASOS customer care team but not one has been helpful and each one has told me conflicting information.

I paid for a premium delivery option to get my package sent to me between 18:00 -22:00 on sunday evening. However the package actually turned up mid afternoon and was tucked behind our bins. The only reason we found it because we were cutting our hedge later on. When i complained to ASOS, the tracking link actually said i signed for it at 20.45. This was not the case. However ASOS merely said that this wasnt their problem and I should speak to UK mail as they are a sepearate company. This is terrible customer service. When you order something from ASOS, you are putting trust in them that they'll get what you ordered to you as requested. if this doesnt happen, you would hope they would take responsibiltiy for it. I would advise people to use some of the newer up and coming ecommerce sites who take responsibilty for their suppliers and value their customers!",1,ASOS,2

I spoke to Beth earlier today who said if it had not been revived by 22:00 to get back in touch, I did this and now Tuan has told me I could receive my order up until midnight. I find this highly unlikely since Hermes haven’t updated the tracking page since 01:46 where they acknowledge they have received the package however it does not show that it is even out with a courier yet and it’s now 22:28.",1,ASOS,2

My purchase was during the $30 off $150 and $50 off $200 promo

I spent over $200 and qualified for the $50 off. However I received a wrong item and thus sent it back. The response refund my $6, not send me the correct item and me paying full price for my other items which is $169.

Over 5 emails and many FB messages later. Same responses, since I used the $50 promo I cant receive the $30 promo even though it was their mistake

But here's another $50 off, I just have to spend another $200 to get it. So $319 overall for a discount I should of gotten, due to a mistake on their end. And fingers cross it doesn't happen again....cause wrong item, wrong sizing, no matter who is at fault if the order isn't perfect you lose your discount and will pay in full.",1,ASOS,2

Jordan Tyler Caskie,2019-09-30T11:58:53Z,Hands down the WORST company,"This is hands down the WORST company to use for online clothes shopping.Firstly they may have a large selection of choice but half of it is the worst quality you can possibly get and the other half doesn't come through looking anything like what they're marketing. With all of this in mind I thought I'd get an order of T-shirts done through this website for my upcoming holiday. The idea being it would be an easy purchase as everything is in one place. My god i couldn't have been any more wrong. They firstly take over the 5 working days they say they would to deliver (7 days taken) but on top of this they send my order to an address I lived in almost 7 years ago!!!! I had just updated my billing and delivery addresses and set as my default as I hadn't used the site in a while and it said it had been confirmed. Even on my checkout page it said my new delivery address. I then received an email saying they'd delivered my clothing to my address from 7 years ago this morning and chat to the customer services team (Taylor and then Thameena) who basically told me this is my problem. They wouldn't listen to the fact that I updated my details and it stated that on my order summary and kept putting the blame back on me. The end result was Taylor closed the chat down because he couldn't be bothered to sort it out himself and then Thameena kept on with the ""Your problem not ours"". They have literally robbed me of £85 due to a system error there end and are flat out refusing to re-send my parcel or refund my money. There only advice has been to do the 80 mile round trip to my old address to pick up my parcel - they didn't offer to pay for the petrol funnily enough.

Lesson learned - I will never ever use this site again. Absolutely shocking customer services and a company that can't hold their hand up when they've made a mistake. Even if i need a quick clothing solution it would be quicker for me to visit each individual brand's shop then order through this absolute joke of a website/company. You stole £85 of my money and I'll do whatever I can to make this known to everyone.",1,ASOS,2

They have basically stolen my money and banned me from the site so now I can't even talk to them.

The order was never received- Wasn't explained as to why (this was next day and I had to chase/ check the delivery tracker MYSELF to be told 5 days later it's being sent back to the retailer).

Then having to chase this up AGAIN I received a response saying it has arrived there....I was only refunded £30 of a £81.99 order. I was told that these are probably being processed individually but this is still no excuse for such terrible service & almost a week of waiting for the funds to be put back into my account & almost 2 weeks since originally making this next day order!!

I spoke to customer service who said there was an error on the page and if I bought them at full price I'd be refunded the difference. I agreed to it and bought them. I pay for premier delivery yet the order never showed. When it finally arrived the following day, the packaging was ripped open and the shoes were missing. The delivery driver told me to refuse the order. I got on to customer service again. They told me that I had to accept it and then return it. I knew this wasnt right as I'd be liable for the missing shoes. I told them I didnt wanna full refund I just wanted my shoes and the partial refund. They told me this was misinformation and wouldn't get the partial refund. I decided I wanted a full refund as they werent going to honour what they had told me. The same delivery continued to come to me for another 2 days after this, to which I refused it. A week and a half later I recieved the email about my refund. They had only refunded me for the t shirts. I spoke to customer service again who said they will look into it for me.

Very very late response. No one understand anything said say that is the correct amount and closed the chat while i am writing try to send me the original copy of my order to see how much I paid.

I am a 63 years young lady who has only returned things if they don't fit or don't look like the picture. In April this year, I also paid for a year's free delivery. I suspect this is what they don't like - that I am returning items but haven't paid the delivery charge in the first place - perhaps not viable for them?

Anyway, I shall not shop with them any more. Told Daniel on the Chat service but he wasn't bothered. I can't purchase online if I don't have the facility to return unsuitable items (who does?) and Asos have totally disregarded my many years of loyalty to them in the past.

We received no real apology for this and no compensation on either occasion of contacting customer services. We are less than 2 weeks away from our wedding and all we were told is we would have to reorder the shoes if we wanted them in time, which came at an added cost of £5.99 for next day delivery, which we were told would be reimbursed- strangely no note was left on the account to advise this would be the case and low and behold - no refund on the £5.99 was given. It is clear to me from the communication we have had and the errors on their part, that their staff need some serious training.

I did so this morning, but they were simply informing me I was being refunded 106 dollars because the dress I ordered on August 1st, shipped on August 3rd, and WAS IN MY LITERAL CITY August 8th OUT FOR DELIVERY (according to FedEx) was no longer in stock. In fact on FedEx the shipment still says it’s pending and on the truck. No longer in stock!! So they sent my dress back to ASOS, didn’t inform me that they had done so, and now it’s no longer in stock so I’m assuming they shipped it to someone else. This is 100% THEIR FAULT.

Megan Herbert,2019-08-24T09:11:56Z,"Same old story - useless customer service, steer clear of this dumpster fire","Agree with 90% of the posts on here. Customer service is an appalling joke. 

I had a similar experience to many of the recent posts. I have next day delivery premier service, have had for several years. To be honest, it’s always been a bit spotty, but I usually do receive the items within 2 days. While not ideal, this typically works for me as I anticipate it and order earlier than I should have to.

 I placed an order on Thursday, 22 August, hoping to receive it by Sunday. The ‘next day’ delivery service is always automatically selected, I’m fairly certain it was this time as well, but with things like this you can never be 100% certain unless you’re constantly taking screenshots. Anyways, Next day there is no parcel, so I log onto my account and see that expected delivery service is not until 30 August. Over a week past ordering. 

So, I think that surely there’s been a mistake and I’ll contact customer service and they’ll be able to help sort this out. That’s what customer service is there for, right? Of course, there’s no number to call, so I try live chat. Absolutely useless. I explain my situation, the rep tells me that I selected standard delivery so it is what it is (again, pretty certain I didn’t but can’t be 100% certain either). I tell her that if I did, it was a mistake, and ask if there’s any way to amend the delivery service as the order won’t be fulfilled for over a week. I just get lots of copy and pasted responses that are no help whatsoever. I ask if there’s any way I can call and speak to a person - nope, of course not. I ask if I can cancel my order as it will no longer be needed in a week - nope, not that either. I was advised that I can reorder, but half of the order is now out of stock so not helpful either.

I didn’t feel like I was talking to an actual person. Every response was obviously just pre-written drivel copy and pasted directly from the website with no regard to actually remedying the issue. It’s so infuriating and I don’t know why they even bother with customer service if they’re not going to at least try to find a solution.

Anyways. Rant over. Moral of the story: if something goes wrong, don’t expect any sympathy from their robot-esque customer service. I won’t be ordering from ASOS again.",1,ASOS,2

Thought i would try and get back some of the money i pay for the 'Premier delivery service' and you just quote me T&C's saying i have had the service over a month and it cannot be cancelled.

Today (Monday) i contacted ASOS because there was no update 'in the morning' and they said I have to wait until the 19th! Which is THURSDAY for my parcel... I specifically purchased Premier delivery so I could get it before my holiday tomorrow (Tuesday). The customer service said they COULD NOT offer me a refund even though I not going to receive the stuff until after I come back from holiday and by then I won't need it. Especially as I now have to go out later this evening to buy all the stuff I need instead. They also told me, they could refund my Premier delivery but this meant I wouldn't get my years worth of next day delivery. Absolutely appalling",1,ASOS,2

I’ve had a parcel delivered and the driver clearly left it outside the flat (he even attached a picture of it in front of the door) even though I never agreed to that option. Contarily, the tracking says I signed for it, while I was provably at work during the time of the delivery.

At no point did I receive an apology from anyone, I just got an automated email to say my items had been refunded.

This item is completely white so I have no idea how someone could not have spotted it, they have just stopped caring. I have been buying from ASOS for 8 years and the standard has just been slipping further and further. I have let alot of things go, with regards to items not being 100% as I'm not overly fussy but to get period stained clothes sent to my house is another level. They should be ashamed. All I was told was to return the item and they would refund me, like they are doing me a favour. I wanted to know how this could happen and how the standards could be so low to be told it is human error. Didn't seem to see why I was so upset, I just don't want to use them anymore. The customer service is not friendly, very matter of fact and that's not what the customer wants. I had an experience with another brand a few weeks ago with a faulty dress and the comparison in customer service is unbleveable. They treat customers right and like they care.

I placed an order last Saturday, with a worth of almost 500£. It was urgent for me (my girlfriend) to get it delivered fast since she really needed some of the items in the order on a banquette the following Wednesday. So, they had at least 3 working days to deliver. To really make sure we would get it in time, I bought an extra service that would guarantee delivery the next working day - in this case, the Monday. 

Now its Thursday and I still haven't received the package. And I don't know at all when I can expect it since I'm given no information at all.  That's not the worst part.  The customer service and the way they handle this situation is. Go spend your money somewhere else, is my advise..",1,ASOS,2

I contacted ASOS via messenger *after they'd ignored earlier emails for 24hours. ASOS claim they have no ability to influence the delivery companies who they have allowed (allegedly) to decide to return the parcel to them. What's more annoying is the DHL driver turning up in my office on Monday 3rd claiming to be there to collect a parcel. Now I'm thinking the parcel has been stolen or gone missing and ASOS say they will process a refund when they get the parcel back. This is unacceptable, ASOS are responsible for delivering goods (by law)  and by a specified date.

It was not, I also didn't get any type of tracking info with the JJFI code, and had two separate ones from the UB Send. Contacted Finnish Posti, they said that ASOS just has shipped a huge ammount of parcels to Finnish customers with faulty tracking codes and Posti is unable to tell that will the Finnish ASOS customers ever receíve the parcels they ordered. Contacted ASOS, they say that I would have to wait to 23rd to able to ask about refund - that's plus 10 days to their standard 25 day refund timeframe. I asked to show the company policy, which supposedly prevents them from doing an immediate refund. They didn't do that, linked me to a page about UK Precise Delivery Service (Finland is not even on the list of countries to which they provide that service). The page had zero mentionings about ASOS refund policies. Got an immediate impression, that the extra 10 days is for them to use some kind of loop hole and not make the refunds in case the parcels don't actually reach their Finnish customers before that 23rd. On top of that the customer service was quite weak, not rude, just not helpful. Thoughts about an internet scam are now floating in my head.",1,ASOS,2

Raine G,2019-06-12T19:06:33Z,Customer service is SHOCKING,"Clothes from Asos are great, not the problem. 
However there customer service is ridiculous. 
I’ve waited over a week for my order, due date is today and I received the tracking information. 
To then find out my parcel has been sent back to them within the hour of them sending it... due to a damaged package. 
I doubt that very much. 
I emailed them to resolve my problem. 
They told me to reorder the items, although one of the two items is out of stock. 
They didn’t care, I asked for a discount/ free delivery because this was a hassle for me. 
Again no help, the lady said to me, if you look on Facebook you’ll find one there. 
And I have to wait 7 days for a refund from a package I never received.  I don’t think so. 
Asos, I hope you read this. Your customer service is absolutely ridiculous and this isn’t the first time I’ve had ridiculous service from you.",1,ASOS,2
Jordyn Bash,2019-08-16T14:05:04Z,I wish I could give zero stars due to…,"I wish I could give zero stars due to poor quality, lack of communication, horrendous customer service, late delivery and ultimately the company sending an EMPTY BOX (which they claimed ""got lost""). I'd also like to add for reference that I have NEVER written a bad review on any company in my life. 

I ordered a few items for the first time from ASOS. One of the items I had to return because the material was like tissue paper, the other (a dress I ordered for a wedding) had a broken zipper. I had to return the dress and repurchase a new one rather than having a replacement sent out for me. I ordered the second dress at the end of July and was told that I'd be receiving the dress Aug 2nd. 

I came home from a trip August 11th and the package had not arrived. I then had to contact the company 3 times to get a straight answer on why my package had not arrived. I was assured by the first two that I would get an answer ""in 24 hrs"" (this is days before the wedding). 

Finally I was told by someone on my third attempt that the dress was lost, that they were out of stock and that I would just get a refund. I called FedEx to follow up and FedEx reported that the box ASOS sent out was actually empty, hence why they never delivered it. ASOS denies this, told me they would only give me a refund. No extra incentive to make up for the inconvenience. 
So I now have no dress for a wedding that is in two days and spent about 45mins of my own time attempting to just get an answer. 

Needless to say I would rather go to Nordstrom on Black Friday than ever order from this company again.",1,ASOS,2

They keep closing chat on me as they can’t contact their own delivery company and they have to go by their tracking info meaning they couldn’t deliver it because of security door. Not to mention I live in canary wharf and gnewt depot is literally three stops away from me.. how ducking hard is it to deliver it on time? Happened more than once already. Definitely not willing to pay for it as I ordered through klarna. They can deal with ASOS themselves if they want, I’m done.

I ordered a ski suit on a next day so I had enough time receive my order and try the fit before my ski holiday.

I received a Tall fur collar denim jacket costing £24. How? 

More shocking was ASOS resolution to their mistake....

I contacted ‘customer service’. To be told to send a £24 item back before I can receive my £192 item.. taking up to 28 days to process. 
*I needed my ordered item to be sent straight away on a next day.

I even suggested I take the incorrect item to the post office and email proof of posting. OR
Pay the £24 for the incorrect item ..and then send that item back for a refund, with my correct item being sent to me ASAP on a next day.

I was told  to place another order for the item I should have received and pay another £192, so £384 in total - for Asos’ £24 mistake. An absolute joke.

Here is your ASOS chat transcript:

ASOS
[15:58:27] You're now chatting to Alfie
Duncan Hewitt
[15:58:29] The Lindbergh relaxed fit trousers have come with a white strip down the side rather than a turquoise. Why is this and can you switch them over please?
ASOS
[15:58:30] Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you.   Your chat reference is 18880266.
[15:59:16] Hi Duncan, Thanks for getting in touch. I'm sorry to hear your item is wrong. Please bear with me for a few minutes whilst I have a look into this for you.
Duncan Hewitt
[15:59:55] it's odd because on the label and packaging it all matches up but the strip is the wrong colour
ASOS
[16:01:52] So we can get this sorted for you, please return your item back to us within 28 days for free for a full refund or a replacement. If you want a replacement of the item, indicate this on the returns note and if the item is still in stock we’ll ship a replacement to you. If you want a refund or your item is out of stock,  we’ll refund you for the item and drop you an email to confirm. To find out more about how to return, and select your country from the 'return from' list. Please fill in the section on the back of your delivery note to say the item is incorrect and put the note in your parcel when you send it back. Do ask for proof of postage and ensure you keep it safe in case we need to look at it later on. 
Duncan Hewitt
[16:02:36] Can you check if the correct item in stock? I don't want to send them back and then am told the item I'm after is out of stock
ASOS
[16:02:51] I can, bear with me
[16:03:48] I can see they are in stock but they are low, so I would recommend re ordering them and sending the wrong ones back to us for a refund.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:05:21] That is a lot of hassle. Can't you order the correct ones, get them sent out to me whilst in the meantime I return the trousers to you. It is your error after all
ASOS
[16:05:35] We're not able to do this for you Duncan
Duncan Hewitt
[16:06:09] So, I have to spend more money to correct an error your team has made? Then wait for x amount of days for you to refund me for your mistake?
ASOS
[16:07:02] I'm sorry about this, you don't have to place the new order. You can wait for an exchange
Duncan Hewitt
[16:08:49] Yes, but that is a risk. This is nowhere near good enough. Clearly it is not personally your fault but I expect to be treated better than this. Happy to talk to somebody more senior if so. I'm a loyal and regular customer. I've just spent £130 on clothes with you. An item is wrong so you guys need to sort this, not me
ASOS
[16:09:16] We are all empowered to give the same level of customer service so a supervisor or a manager will not be advising you any different, They also do not work on live chats. We have processes in place and have to advise according to them.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:10:13] Absolutely. But when a process is not adequately working for a customer then they must be allowed to go beyond them. It doesn't have to be on live chat. You can get them to call me or I can call them.
ASOS
[16:10:45] I understand but we will not be able to do anything else for you. This will need to be returned and refunded or exchnaged
[16:10:54] *Exchanged
Duncan Hewitt
[16:12:00] Yes, so send me the correct item immediately and I will begin the returns process from this end. The price is the same, the code is the same so I do not understand why I need to create a whole new order. This order will also charge me for delivery.
ASOS
[16:12:32] I'm unable to send you a new item Duncan, If you get back in contact after you place the new order we can get this refunded for you
Duncan Hewitt
[16:13:44] Ok Alfie you are now bordering on being unhelpful. You have a very simple choice as a business. You either work with me and compensate me for this error, either financially or through customer service or I can just return the whole order and not use your service again. It's a very simple choice you have your end
ASOS
[16:14:31] I understand, i'm sorry about this but we aren't able to send out a replacement for this.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:14:46] It isn't a 'new' item - it is the item I ordered which you messed up
[16:14:56] Ok, please give me a number to call for somebody to talk to
ASOS
[16:15:15] We don't have a direct line so we're not set up to receive phone calls and are an online company so we deal with all complaints and queries via Live Chat, Email, Twitter and Facebook.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:16:01] Ok, then deal I would now like to make a complaint
[16:16:15] What is the correct process to go through to make a complaint?
ASOS
[16:16:23] No problem, you can send this over to me on the live chat and I will get it sent over to the relevant team.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:16:42] And how will they contact me?
ASOS
[16:17:04] They won't be back in contact, we will use this internally to improve our services
Duncan Hewitt
[16:17:57] Sorry, what? No, no, no. Please give me a way to contact a more senior member of staff? A decision maker. Otherwise, what is the point in having management?
ASOS
[16:18:26] As previously advised a manager won't be able to advise you differently, and they also don't work live chats
Duncan Hewitt
[16:19:33] Read very carefully what I am saying, Alfie. It doesn't have to be on live chat. Give me a way to contact a member of management. I'm not going to be put off by you saying a manger won't be able to help me any differently. I still request to speak to one so please advise on how to do this
ASOS
[16:21:57] Our managers do not get back in contact with customers via email, Duncan. I'm sorry about this. We are all trained to the same level here at ASOS so a manager would not be able to advise you any different. We are also an online based company so we don't take phone calls at customer care.
Duncan Hewitt
[16:23:27] So how do I contact a manager? It is such a simple question
ASOS
[16:23:52] Your unable to get in contact with a manager
Duncan Hewitt
[16:24:08] *you're
[16:24:14] So what is their purpose?
[16:26:41] I would now like to report the item I ordered as missing. It is not in the package so I no longer want it and would like for the missing item to be refunded. I don't want an exchange and I don't want to purchase anything else. Please action this
ASOS
[16:26:58] Thank you for that correction. They are here to help with any questions I have about queries, which I have done and they have advised the same as me. We have processes to follow here at ASOS
[16:28:08] As I have advised all I can I will go ahead and close the chat. If there is anything else then please do get back in contact. Thanks
[16:28:17] ASOS have ended the chat",1,ASOS,2

They said they cannot refund because it’s on it’s way and will be there by 3/15. They sent me a tracking number which brings me to a page that’s says delivery date has not yet been determined. I’m just so mind blown. I feel bad because I used to really like  this company, but something is going on and they have my money and I have yet to see any merchandise.

Nadine Birchall,2019-07-02T09:28:55Z,Unacceptable customer service,"I have ordered from ASOS for years but just recently I have found their customer service unacceptable. I placed an order for £100 using my premier delivery. I received an email to say my order would be with me the next day. It never arrived. I called Asos the following day to be told by Julie that I have to wait a further 4 working days (5 in total) and if my order doesn’t turn up I should then call for them to refund or replace. I expressed that this is not what I would expect for next day delivery. She then told me that apparently this is all in my terms and conditions. So please beware do not rely on next day delivery or that Asos will have any interest in assisting you in the event your order goes missing but they are quite happy to keep my £100 for a further 4 days before they will even try and resolve this for me.
Update..the items arrived 5 days later in Hermes packaging with no returns label or sheet. Two items missing and two faulty. They sent out the missing items which took a further 3 days. The faulty items had clearly been worn, had no tags on and looked like they had come out of someone’s wash basket. One was discoloured and the other had faulty buttons. I was asked to return these for replacements to be sent. I returned them once I printed my own returns label and sheet, requesting replacements. 
I received an email yesterday telling me my refund had been processed for £4! The items o returned amounted to £24. As I had used a spend and save voucher they have removed my discount from the whole order and refunded me only £4. I queried why they have refunded when I wanted replacements only to be told the items were out of stock. This was a complete lie because I checked and both had plenty of stock. Anyway all they could offer me was another promo code so I’d have to spend another £100...I think not!!! Absolutely terrible Asos!!!",1,ASOS,2

They are rude and just use generic robotic responses (they could quite well be robots). They don't keep you updated when you have a query they just leave you wondering what is happening whilst you do not have your money or your items.


I am still astonished how you managed to pack 3 items out of the 14 within the order and send it without including any paperwork or anything else. How did you go so wrong?

Adam Stephens,2018-11-29T11:13:15Z,Placed an order with premium next day…,"Placed an order with premium next day delivery to a DPD collection point. Order sent back by DPD with message saying can't delivery to any address other than billing address. ASOS live chat fobs me off with 'please wait 7 days for the order to be returned so we can process and refund then you can place a new order'. After much back and forth I get an email saying the delivery never left ASOS and they are sending a new order (minus 2 items that are now out of stock) which will be delivered to the same collection point the next day. Well, today is the next day and what do you know... I get the same 'order sent back by DPD' email so again I get on ASOS live chat to be given the same cookie cutter response of wait 7 days blah blah blah. So, to summarise, like most peoples experience, if you order their stuff and it arrives then you probably think they're great. However, if you order their stuff and it doesn't arrive... well, the reviews speak for themselves. I imagine after several further chat and email conversations I'll eventually get a refund for the order, by which time the remaining items will likely be out of stock too. If only Wiggle branched out into fashion...",1,ASOS,2
Henrik Diget,2018-11-28T01:18:48Z,Monkey or human?,"Just an update - after i made the original review i send an Email to ASOS with my claim. Within 6 hours i think we had come to a solution. Don't know if i where lucky or the department at the emails are more competent than the Chat people which i had the displeasure of chatting with for an un-constructive hour. The below (original review) i still stand buy in regard to their chat service:

Their items might be quite all right and maybe even cheap, but their customer support can only be described as tragic. You dont know if you are talking to a human or a monkey pressing buttons generating random and uncorrelated answers... If you get a good deal buy from them, just be prepared for the most tragic and unhelpful experience of your life if you need to contact them, and i am saying this after my girlfriend dumped me last week.",1,ASOS,2

Sent me the wrong pair of jeans. Aware the correct pair were showing as low stock I asked if a pair could be held as it could take upto 7 days for an exchange to be processed. It was explained to me this was not possible. I then asked if I was to purchase the original item again to speed this up would they honour the original
Sale price as since my order the price has gone up. This was refused. 

So basically I have to wait 7 days if I’m the meantime the item I paid for goes out of stock it’s bad luck and I get a refund. ASOS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MISTAKES. WONT SHOP HERE AGAIN!",1,ASOS,2

I contacted them and was told that a calling card was left and they were unable to deliver as I wasn’t in. I can confirm I was in all day and I even left a safe place for them to leave the parcel if I wasn’t there! They clearly didn’t use that safe place (meaning they didn’t even bother to try and deliver). I then went onto their live chat which was absolutely appalling! One of them said to me ‘I’ve said all I can say so I’m closing the chat now, have a nice day’ I then tried a different way of contacting and making a complaint via Facebook and had a terrible experience there too! She constantly just kept using pre worded templates and said feedback will be passed on when I kept clearly stating I wanted to make an official complaint. I am not ordering with them ever again!

Hannah Young,2019-08-13T06:48:07Z,"Terrible customer service, useless phone operators. Appalled.","I have been dealing with an issue with ASOS for the last week.
I made an initial order of 7 items and when the package arrived, only 3 items were in the bag. I took photographic evidence and called to ask where the rest of the items were. It turns out there was a fault with the warehouse.

They put in a query to the managers who would look into it, assess, and then send out the missing items and would take up to 48 hours. After 3 days I heard nothing back so called and I was advised that they would cancel the re-send out and I could just order the items again on a new order number and would be reimbursed the next day delivery charge. I did this. I have now received 2 emails saying both the replacement order has been dispatched and the new order has been dispatched so I will have duplicates of everything.

I called yesterday with my new order number to get my reimbursement of next day delivery. It wouldn't issue it until it had been dispatched. I called again this morning after receiving the dispatch info last night. Again, there was another issue and I have to wait another 48 hours until it shows up on my account.


I am absolutely disgusted with how this situation has been handled. No one knows what they're doing or knows the right information. I have found the people on the phone to be sharp, rude and unhelpful.

I am a long serving, loyal customer of ASOS for many, many years. I work with very high profile people, I place clothes on them, I promote the brand and quite frankly have never experienced such awful customer service. It could have been so simple, but everyone has given me different answers. I have spent hours on the phone and I am now considering not purchasing anything from them again.",1,ASOS,2

Once I had my order, three days later I got an email saying that my order had been dispatched. I was so excited! 
Two days  after that I checked my emails again to see that they had cancelled my order and 'refunded' my afterpay - with no reason or explanation as to why.

Tracy Rooney,2019-06-11T13:33:10Z,WHERE IS ASOS’S CUSTOMER SERVICE.....,"WHERE IS ASOS’S CUSTOMER SERVICE.....
...............
I have been a loyal customer with ASOS for years, as they have lovely clothes and great prices.


HOWEVER, on the one and only time I have had the unfortunate displeasure in contacting ASOS, due to an order that had suddenly midway in delivery been returned to ASOS, without the delivery company attempting delivery, with no explanation, and I had to contact both ASOS chat and email them to find out why. Unfortunately, I was met with un apologetic, in-personable and generic scripted responses, stating sorry  if my order/parcel was being sent back to ASOS , it could be due to being damaged or no one being in, and a full refund would occur in 5-10 days once they had received the parcel, and THEY could not resend the items ordered due to SECURITY REASONS. If I wanted to order again, as I had commented I had to wait for a refund, to use Klarna .......

So they offered no help to contact the delivery company to establish why my order was being returned just a blunt unhelpful statement that  the parcel was being returned  for some unknown reason, and once they have received it they would then  process it, and I would receive a refund in 5-10 days........  ASOS CUSTOMER SERVICES , WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

3 days later I receive a bashed up parcel which was sloppily taped in the delivery companies tape, and box open and damaged, containing a partial order with no invoice.

I then had to contact ASOS email again to find out why I have received a partial order in a bashed up and ripped open box, when on 2 occasions ASOS customer services told me that it was being returned to them, not aware of why, and I would be receiving a full refund, and they would be unable to resend my original order out.

Yet again I was met with lack lustre generic email and apology, with a refund for the item that was missing, but no explanation  why I’ve received a partial order in a damaged delivery box when THEY stated I wouldn’t be receiving the items.


After several emails with generic responses of ASOS customer services taking no responsibility, and implying it was the delivery companies fault and not answering my questions on why my order and delivery was such a shambles, where at one moment I wasn’t receiving it I would be getting a refund, to 3 days later receiving a partial order in a bashed and damaged box, and myself informing them of this and that a item was missing with no explanation or acknowledgement of the stress and frustration of myself having to chase the status of the order over 6-7 emails in total, over 4 days in total.
 
ASOS took no responsibility, none whatsoever, and no personable sincere apology was received apart from there generic responses. Other online companies have bent over backwards when there has been a problem with one of my deliveries, they have contacted and kept me informed of the situation after I initially contacted them, and I’ve felt like a person and valued customer, and I’ve been offered sincere apologies and vouchers for the inconvenience.


UNFORTUNATELY NOT WITH ASOS, THEY OFFER GENERIC SCRIPTED RESPONSES, ACKNOWLEDGING NO RESPONSIBILITY OR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER HAS TO DO ALL THE CHASING, WITH NO SINCERE APOLOGY OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS.


ASOS YOU NEED TO REVIEW YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICY AND RHETORIC, AS YOU HAVE NONE. THIS CAN ALSO BE MIRRORED BY OTHER CUSTOMERS REVIEWS ALSO. ASOS. You need to treat your so called valued customers as VALUED......",1,ASOS,2

I saw that Next Day Delivery wasn't an option for me and Premier Delivery wasn't showing on my Account. I emailed ASOS and it took 2 days to get a reply back to tell me to clear my cookies which should fix the problem. That obviously wasn't the issue as it was happening on their iOS app but I did it anyway and tried again but to no avail. I responding to the agent with screenshots of the order when I bought it and they told me that they were transferring me to another team to investigate.

I recently had a bad experience with one of my purchases, and asked for a goodwill gesture of a refund, however they kept refusing it because what happened wasn’t thei fault. However, the carrier delivered the parcel on a different day from what was said on the order, I wasn’t at home, they didn’t confirm my name and my coat got stole. They gave me a 10% discount to use for another purchase as their way to make it up, but since I had to refund the item due to wrong size, they refused to issue the 10% again, so it was a total waste.

If you just shop, receive your items ok and send them back, then I guess it’s ok. But try to reach out for extra help to their “customer care” and all you get is a big headache and no solutions to your issues at all.

It doesn’t matter if I live in the ghettos or if I live in the 2 million dollar house, as long as I signed the waiver Asos, let me the costumer make that decision! Whether is safe or not to leave my packages at the front door. Gabrielle’s response on deeming safe made insulted me and made me laugh at the same time. Purely incompetent, a loss of my time and money, no manager they could escalate this issue to, and their support consists of copy/paste of b-s policy every other two minutes when I keep insisting that I feel duped by them both , Asos and DHL.

Oh and now if you return products to them because they have made a mistake e.g. wrong size, colour or a totally different ptoduct, don't expect a refund anytime soon as it takes ages to get your money back due to their new policy (they do have a return policy but interestingly no complaints policy so it seems). Make sure you keep your return receipts as proof of sending products back as they will try to make out they have not received  them. It never used to be this way. Too much hassle when there are other online stores who fulfil their obligations and offer better products and a greater quality customer service.

Chloe Smith,2019-04-05T11:37:43Z,Wish I could do 1* - FRAUD,"Wish I could do 1* 
Such bad customer service.... I stopped using ASOS a year ago due to poor customer service and when a £100 gift card I got given didnt work, they refused me for 3 months to get a new one which did work saying I had already used it when I didnt even use them before..

NOW I have tried them again, returned all my items and not being allowed a REFUND. this has been going on for a month now. Each time I talk to customer service chat they say ""somoene already responded to this query"" well no... because no one has got back to me

Now today I tried for 2 hours, five convos later because people just kept closing the convo or because after 5 minutes of not talking or responding it automatically closes (litte hint here, every few minutes just keep messaging so they cant cancel the call)

Still here, trying to get my money back.... should have stuck wth my gut.

Tony White,2019-04-04T17:15:25Z,Terrible.... DONT USE,"I put an order through for a shirt I needed next day so purchased the next day delivery. The amount was taken from my PayPal account and I did not receive any comms about the order. 

I than followed up the next day in the ""chat"" and the first operator simply cut me off as I did not have an order number even though I explained I had PayPal invoice no 399293021. The second time around the lady ""Rebecca"" informed me that they had taken my money but had a technical issue and would not be able to fulfil.

I was relying on this for an occasion I was attending, but no apology or explanation other than a ""tech"" issue.

Michael Evans,2018-12-20T10:35:23Z,Bought 10th Dec - in stock - Might deliver sometime in January...,"Bought a Christmas gift on Dec 10th for my Dad. Chased it a week later and tracking said that Hermes were still waiting for it. In my experience working with parcel networks this item is lost so I called and asked them to send a replacement. They told me they can't and won't do anything until 7 working days. This apparently works out that they won't take an action until the 24th Dec. As they're busy, they said it would also take 5-8 days to reprocess/deliver the reorder (a Christmas gift). Requested to cancel the order, as a Christmas gift on 2nd Jan is about as useful as a prophylactic sheath on a maternity ward. Conveniently they also can't cancel an order until 7 working days afterwards. 

Am now looking forwards to either cancelling the order or returning the item. Shocking festive experience.

EDIT: Called on Christmas Eve as directed, told that they couldn't do anything until the end of the day at 10pm - advised to call bak on Boxing day.

Called on Boxing day, jumper was delivered on 27th Dec. Gave to my Dad as a 2nd present, he likes the jumper.

So I called fedex and they said the package was found to be empty and they will not deliver the empty package to me and that I need to contact ASOS.

I explained to them that I ordered with expedited 2 day shipping and I need a fund because I will be leaving the country this week and will not be here nor will I need the clothing once I am gone. They will not give me a refund even though I will not receive my package. So now I am stuck with no clothes and no money.

All this person did was elevate the issue to a 'specialist team' who will respond to me within a lightning 24 hours, then couldn't tell me why a specialist team was even necessary. It's a simple return. Apparently ASOS pride themselves on their easy and fast returns - fail to see how. When I asked the consultant why their responses were taking so long, they (eventually) suggested it was my internet connection. I suggested it might be theirs and they quite arrogantly asserted they were not experiencing any issues at that time. When I queried that, the consultant (suddenly quite rapidly) informed me that they were dealing with more than one customer at a time. I suggest therein lies the problem and that ASOS don't employ enough customer service consultants, they have a clunky and inefficient internal process for addressing returns/issues, and certainly either don't give customer service staff appropriate customer service training, or don't actually monitor the quality of their service. At no point did this person apologise for any delays or my dissatisfaction with the responses provided. Hopeless.

I told her the tracking status said it was with them but she insisted I had to wait 7 working days. I asked to speak to a manager and repeatedly asked for my complaint to be escalted but was ignored. Waited until the 7th working day and was then told I had to wait until the end of the day and if I hadn’t received an email get back in touch. Very generic responses and not helpful at all. Contacted on the 8th working day and was told it’s now been passed to a “specialist team” and it would take a further 3 working days!

Sleepy in Austin,2019-06-27T20:12:18Z,"Buyer beware - you may lose your money and never receive clothes. Worst customer ""care"" I've ever experienced.","I placed an order for approximately 11 items on 6/14/19. I had recently moved states and at checkout entered my new address. My items were supposed to be delivered on 6/26/19. When they hadn't arrived by 6/27/19, I checked the tracking status to discover they had been delivered to my old address, over 1000 miles away. I contacted customer service via chat (because they do not provide a phone number, I assume that's because they experience so many issues) and explained their system had made a mistake and delivered my package to my old address. My correct delivery address is on my profile on their site, and it could not be there unless I had entered it when I placed my order as I had not previously ordered from this address. Customer service told me I would need to retrieve the package myself or have the new tenant return the package to ASOS at which point they would give me a refund. When I explained that neither option was possible as I now lived over 1000 miles away and did not know the new tenant and had no way of contacting them to retrieve my package, they told me there was nothing else they could do. When I requested that I be transferred to their management, they refused. When I asked what I was supposed to do, they said the new tenant at my old address may return it to ASOS. I explained this was not plausible and that I needed to be issued a refund as I hadn't received the products I paid for and it was due to an error on their end, they replied that ""sometimes it happens."" I insisted that I be refunded my money and they cut off the chat, when I started another chat they left me on hold for as long as they could, and then repeated the same lines and cut off the chat again. So I have now paid over $160 and haven't received a single thread of clothing. They are stealing from customers. DO NOT TRUST THEM AND DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS.

This has been going on for too long now and i’ve tried many times to reach out to customer service with regards to next day delivery, i ordered two times and both times it wasn’t delivered the next day and it took a couple of days which is bad service, you don’t even get what you pay for.

Demi Colleen,2019-07-15T14:19:46Z,I wish I could give zero stars,"I wish I could give zero stars - it would be more appropriate for the abysmal customer service and delivery from this company. I placed three orders in three days, one arrived early but the other two are missing. Each time I speak to Asos, they ask me to wait another week, and then another week; constantly moving the goal posts to buy themselves more time. Their love chat agents are arrogant and rude, they cut off the chat when they cannot be bothered to answer more questions. Their twitter account churns our generic answers that have no relevance to your query. Those answering emails have poor reading comprehension and ignore the questions in your email only to be so unhelpful you almost wish they never even replied. I’m not sure when they started using Hermes but it was big mistake - although this awful incompetent delivery company has a lot in common with Asos lately. They won’t refund you for missing items, but debit your account within seconds. I’m taking it up with PayPal and I won’t stop messaging Asos until I have my money back.",1,ASOS,2

They simply copy and paste the same generic vague response over and over again that doesn't even come close to answering your question.  After 4 emails sent with the same response I had to type an email in capital letters to have them actually read what I was asking them.  Even then, they took almost 2 weeks to respond after having to follow up yet again only to have them come to the same conclusion that I'm able to to return my ill-fitting items for a flat fee that they seemed to have just made up as no delivery service has been able to quote me this price. 

Don't let the website fool you with the bold print going across their landing page saying ""Free returns"".  This is untrue.  Also don't believe what they state as the flat return shipping cost for Canada.  This is also untrue.  Also  had to pay a significant duty fee for their ""Free Shipping"" as well which they don't quote you for or even mention as something to expect when putting your order in.

It is truly despicable the kind of service they deliver for an online retailer.  Definitely do not recommend purchasing from here and I will certainly never buy from them again.",1,ASOS,2

However it did not arrive next day, or the day after or the day after that and so on. So I contacted customer services to see where the parcel was as there was no info forthcoming from the delivery company. I was cut off first time I tried to find out what was happening. I tried again and was given the same rhetoric over and over, wait another 5 days and see what happens. That’s it. No apology, I can’t cancel, I can’t get my money back, they won’t contact the delivery company to see where my parcel is or why the item I have paid for has not gotten to me. Actually, I found them quite impolite and impossible. I asked to speak to a manager and was blocked. The message I’m getting is that they don’t give a damn whether they provide a decent service, whether I get my items, or whether they have taken my money without supplying the goods. This has put me right off of ever using them again. Shocking and very disappointing really for such a big company.",1,ASOS,2
Stephen Boyd,2018-12-14T09:11:37Z,Sort yourselves out ASOS,The previous reviewer (Liz) summed it up. I could simply cut and paste her complaint as mine her rhetoric more or less mirrors mine. I sincerely hope that our honest reviews steer potential customers away from ASOS and exposes how shabbily they treat their customers. I have never encountered a company with such a pathetic ambivalence towards it's customers. Trustpilot tells the world that 58% of 5622 people who have sent a review in are unhappy with your service. That means you have lost more than 3000 customers because of your failed processes and arrogance. Sort yourselves out.,1,ASOS,2
Liz,2018-12-14T08:48:23Z,Appalling Customer service,"I ordered an item from asos on the 1st of December and I have premier delivery which means I have paid for a years worth of next day delivery. The next day the item didnt arrive. I waited two futher days nothing came. I then spoke to asos on their chatline where I was told i had to wait a further 5 days. I spoke to them again on that day and was yet again told to wait a few more days. By now the item i ordered which was for some interviews isnt really needed. 
I have just spoke to them again and they said they will now pass it onto a specialist team but id have to wait a further 48hours to know anything. I was fed up of waiting around and chasing them about the order so I asked to have a full refund and said to forget sending it now. I was them told id be updated abot a possible refund after the specialist team had looked into it. 
So no refund no nearer to finding out where it was than a week ago. I asked to make a formal complaint and was refused. 
I have been a customer with asos for many years and use them fairly regulary but clearly they do not value their customers I am extremely annoyed by the customer service I have recieved 
I understand its a busy time of year and would have been fine if they had emailed me to say theres been a delay or it wasnt possible to deliver next day at the moment instead they made me chase it up repeatedly and brushed off any complaint i tried to make",1,ASOS,2
Rosalie Costa,2019-01-26T19:04:47Z,Have any of you been cheated by this…,"Have any of you been cheated by this website? I have been cheated, fooled. I made my order by the end of November and received my Dispatch confirmation email on December 1st. One week after, while checking the tracking I realized that it was not moving at all, and still showing ''processing''. I started to contact customer service using messenger and spoke with 3 different agents. All of them were talking about some duties payments that were pending to pay so that my order could be released from customs. Apparently, you will be able to create your order on ASOS and paid the amount that you agreed and on top of that, after your order is confirmed and when you cannot cancel anymore, they will send you a second email informing you about some customs duties to pay. In my case, I never received the supposed email and that's why the order show still processing. I wonder what happens if Clients don't pay these HIDDEN DUTIES. Will ASOS receive back the package and keep the Clients money? - I totally believe this is the case, as they already said that the order cannot be canceled.
To all my friends, please avoid using ASOS so that you don't be fooled or cheated. They will make you pay a specific amount, later on, ask you for more money to release the package and if by any chance you never receive that notification, that means that you will never receive nor your package nor your money back.",1,ASOS,2

I placed an order on 30th October and as a premier customer I receive next day delivery all year round. However it is now the 18th November and I still haven’t received my parcel. 
I checked the tracking on Hermes and it said I had to take action and contact Asos, which I did. I emailed Asos and within 24 hours they responded saying that I had to contact Hermes as Asos ‘weren’t able to contact them directly’. 

Even though the delivery of the parcel is the responsibility of Asos, I contacted Hermes but could only reach an automated system which told me that Asos cancelled the courier services on the 7th November. I then emailed Asos customer care again on the 14th November explaining this and as of the 17th I had no reply. I tried to contact Asos on Facebook messenger which says I should have a response within a few hours. Just under 24 hours later they responded asking for my registered email address so they could look into this further and after sending my email address no one has got back to me again. The order was for over £130 and I am appalled at the customer service, or lack of.

I’ve had one order delivered with items missing , and another where one item had clearly been worn and another was damaged. This is not ASOS as I know them.

I called up after spending a good amount of time trying to find a contact number since they don’t have it on their website and make it very difficult to speak with them, and was told that the delivery van had broken down (not what I was previously told) and that once the parcel has changed hands with Hermes delivery there is no way to contact them?! I asked why they couldn’t contact and find out if it could still be delivered and was told it’s in their contract with Hermes that they can’t speak to the delivery driver once they have the parcel...so they aren’t allowed to contact the company that they pay for their service? I then emailed ASOS and was told that they had tried to deliver my item and nobody was home, there were several people home and we have CCTV to prove that nobody tried to deliver the items, but apparently the photo sent as proof of delivery of a blurred black screen is better evidence than our CCTV 🤔 so I’ve been told 3 different versions of why my parcel wasn’t delivered and was offered rude and unhelpful customer service, this is on top of countless parcels being left on my front door step and then stolen or left in dustbins, and even seeing delivery drivers go past my house without stopping and then saying that nobody was home to sign for it. 0/10 for customer service and delivery",1,ASOS,2
Lynn Oo,2019-04-30T03:13:01Z,Awful if ordering outside of Europe,"I've purchased many times from Asos whilst I was living in Europe, mainly in the UK. Never had issues there, returns were easy, did not cost me money to send it back, delivery was quick and refund was settled promptly. 

I ordered from Asos in Canada. I was charged customs fee which literally doubled the cost of my dresses, this was not outlined or stated on the website. Being new in Canada, I had no idea that this fee is flat rate (>$50) regardless of the price of your goods as long as it exceeds $20. 

To make it worse, the dresses I ordered did not fit me despite using the size guide. Their clothing always run too big. I normally wear UK8-10. Nowhere in store, have I ever bought smaller sizes. On Asos, I have to scale down several sizes even when I use the sizing assistant and I answered based on actual measurements/weight. The fit is also clearly off, because every so often, if I order a couple dresses which are all the same size, one might fit while the others run down my knees. My sequin dress is dropping sequins every now and then. I've had to vacuum it up and even then there's still a couple falling off whenever it is shifted. I tried to find the loose thread and just cannot locate it cause it's black.

The worst part is to return to the UK, I will be charged a shipping fee of $22+. This means, the cost of shipping and customs alone would have easily gotten me 3 dresses without the added hassle of purchasing it from overseas and having issues with sizing and having to return it. Really terrible. Do not purchase from Asos unless you live in the UK. I just missed London and hated the clothing/fashion in Canada. Can't believe this just made everything worse.",1,ASOS,2

ASOS
[08:21:18] You're now chatting to Aaron
Me:
[08:21:19] Received email earlier stating order delayed by one day. Really, really need this today as dress is to be worn tomorrow morning. Arrival tomorrow will be too late. I comfortably ordered before cut-off time.
ASOS
[08:21:20] Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you. Your chat reference is 2068xxxx.
[08:21:26] You're now chatting to Aaron
[08:22:05] Hi xxxxx, thanks for getting in contact. I'm sorry to hear your order has been delayed.
[08:22:36] While I look into this for you, I had a quick look on your ASOS account and can see that your premier delivery is about to run out on 30th June so I just thought I'd send over a friendly reminder to update your subscription if you wish to still keep using our unlimited free next day delivery service. - 
[08:24:16] I've had a look into this for you and I understand how you're feeling as you need this dress to wear tomorrow morning. I'm afraid as your order has been subject to a delay we need to please allow until the end of the day on the 28th June 2019 for your order to be delivered.
Me
[08:25:36] Why is it subject to a delay. It's contradictory you selling me a premium delivery when it cannot be achieved.
[08:26:04] Can you sent it via another courier? Like stated I need it wear it tomorrow for a function
ASOS
[08:27:07] I can confirm this is a carrier delays which is outside of our control. I can assure you this is a rare occurrence. I'm afraid we're unable to amend your order once it's been placed and we also are unable to choose which carrier your order goes with. I will need you to please allow until the end of the day on the 28th June 2019 for your order to be delivered.
Me
[08:27:56] Then can you guarantee it will arrive tomorrow 08:00, or before.
ASOS
[08:29:59] I'm afraid i'm unable to guarantee this but I can confirm you will get a timeslot either later today or tomorrow which your order will be delivered in.
Me
[08:30:40] This is very poor service.
[08:31:40] I have payed premium, I wouldn't actually mind it coming Friday or Saturday, but this dress was specifically ordered to wear to a function tomorrow. Can you escalte this, please
ASOS
[08:33:35] I understand how you're feeling about this as you need this for a function tomorrow morning but we do need to allow until the end of the day on the 28th June 2019 for your order to be delivered. I'm unable to pass this to a manager as we're all equipped to help you out equally here at Customer Care and this is a process we all follow. As I've provided you with all the information I can, I will now be closing the chat. Have a nice day and take care 
[08:33:36] ASOS have ended the chat",1,ASOS,2
Van Henry,2019-06-26T22:56:34Z,No stars. Scam,I ordered a suit from Asos and it looks absolutely nothing like the pictures or videos. I ordered a blue suit and it came black. The size was also very different. Definitely false advertising. Their customer service is also very rude and not helpful at all. Do not shop from them.!!,1,ASOS,2
Unsatisfied Customer,2019-03-29T15:14:31Z,Despicable joke of a company.,"Despicable joke of a company.

US sizes are way off. They do not offer exchanges, only returns and then you have to reorder. They’re almost always out of stock of the item when you do reorder. If they’re not, they don’t honor the original price you paid. If it was on sale or discounted when you bought it, but it’s no longer on sale (or if you used a discount code), then you have to pay the higher price for the new items. I’ve never heard of any retailer doing this before. It’s a terrible business practice and is a scam considering the sizes are not correct. 

On top the their terrible policies, their customer support is completely unprofessional. They are rude, not helpful at all (they send a scripted answer to tell you they will look into it and then forward your request to someone else- why even bother having a chat line?), then they end the chat whenever they feel like it, without reaching a resolution or asking if you have additional questions. 

Stay away from this company and stick with brands that actually value their customers!!!",1,ASOS,2
jfair,2019-06-04T15:56:23Z,Absolutely useless,"Absolutely useless. Fail to deliver on time - every single order I've been insane enough to make from them. I should have learned. Their customer service is about as bad as it can get and they really couldn't care less. Refuse to escalate to senior management and ""processes' that involve cutting your off from chat rather than solving the customer's complaints.
I wouldn't usually have anything to do with them but needed a fancy dress outfit.
They don't deserve a single customer the way they treat them",1,ASOS,2

Nobody knows anything and say that as soon as they know something about it, they will send me and email. I’ve been waiting for almost a week and still nothing.

It's like they don't want to give me a refund. The clothes were smelly and big, I've been shopping with asos for 7yrs now but their products are going downhill,  always sending smelly clothes.

When I tried to get help and have them amend their mistake by canceling the order and resending it with the correct shipping, they said I could reorder it again and choose day shipping again, and basically hope it works out. ZERO HELP. Their customer service is consistently trash. I hope they go out of business.",1,ASOS,2
Ashley Herbert,2019-06-03T12:28:53Z,Technical Difficulties Unresolved,"Technical difficulties registering for the 25% off promo for students, Live Chat was absolutely appalling, I'd dread to think how much business this company has lost due to the lack of support provided to customers. 

Chatted to 3 people, 1st person told me it's a TOTUM/NUS fault despite it being a technical fault on the ASOS website.

2nd person, closed the chat saying they had technical difficulties.

3rd person, said the same as above then ignored me.

I was ordering some office wear and the 25% off would've helped me greatly as I was placing a significant order of around £300, I'll be buying the items elsewhere.

Never again, will i touch ASOS or give them my money, I'd advise you all to do the same.",1,ASOS,2

Anna McCabe,2019-01-24T11:58:25Z,terrible customer service and delivery,"I received a gift voucher as a birthday present. After searching for months for something I could by it was so much hassle trying to put all my details in and for them to accept the voucher. The order was then placed and was due to come on Thursday. I woke up on Thursday and then record an email stating that my parcel had tried to be delivered but no one was in. This was false as I definitely was in and no slip had been put through the door like they would normally do. I reached out to ASOS on 2 live chats and both showed very very poor customer service, the first blamed me for this and the second one stated that my parcel was still to come- neither of them took any responsibility for the fact I got an email confirming that my parcel had tried to be delivered, all I wanted to know was what happened and when it would be coming. Customer service is very poor and I still haven’t received my parcel. Will not shop from here ahain",1,ASOS,2
Ieuan,2019-01-24T09:36:32Z,"Lazy, impersonal, careless","The most impersonal and lazy customer service I have ever had. I used the online chat, there was 5 minutes between me typing and them replying which made me feel that my complaint didn't matter from the get go. To top that off I was told I had to wait until midnight for my delivery and only after then when it definitely hadn't been delivered on that day could they engage in a conversation with me about where my order was. I felt like I was either being lied to or dismissed the whole time. In addition to this when I followed up for a refund on my next day delivery I was told they would look in to it and get back to me, I can't comprehend that their system is so complicated to use that they can't see within seconds whether the delivery arrived the day it was meant to. In addition to this when I asked to escalate my complaint and receive a call back from a manager to discuss customer service experience, I was redirected to emailing them (as if I hadn't already contacted them several times) and then not even given the email address? Honestly need to pull their finger out, ASOS website is great but as soon as there's an issue you'll wish you never shopped there. Will be going straight to actual retailers going forward.

On the surface, the asos web site seems comparable to Urban Outfitters or Zara, but the similarities end there when you click to submit your order. At that point, your order falls into the black hole of their order fulfillment and customer care (more like customer chaos). None of the dates will match reality. Your order is “despatched”, which means, thrown in a pile to wait until you complain. The date promised for “delivery” is the date they start manufacturing the items in your order. The “tracking” will indicate “processing” for many days while the items are made. At no point will the tracking actually get updated or show where exactly your package is located. During this process, you contact their customer chaos group, thinking something must be wrong. Scarily, you discover that this is business as usual and the kind of unprofessional chaos that constitutes their company. Each person will lie to you about where the package is and when it is coming. You will hear many different dates from many different people.

If you compare this buffoonery and chaos to dealing with Urban Outfitters, where you can actually talk to real customer care people by phone without waiting on hold, people who can nicely tell you exactly where your order is and the exact day you will receive it, it’s very sad. Compare it to Amazon, and it’s a joke. I’ve waited 2.5 weeks for “in stock” items that Amazon would have delivered in 48 hours. Still have no idea if I will ever receive my order.

If you look on LinkedIn, there are 100+ people listed as the CEO of asos in a range of countries around the world...Australia, Turkey, even someone in West Virginia. If you look on the asos jobs website, it says 30% of their workforce is in the customer chaos group. How come none of them seem to know when a package is scheduled for delivery? How many thousands of people does it take to screw in a light bulb? I’ve conversed with a dozen different people in customer chaos about my package. They all give a different date for delivery. Many of the dates have long past. Some offered me a discount on my next order...why would I throw more money into the black hole when I never received my first order?",1,ASOS,2
Roxann,2018-12-11T01:20:40Z,"OMG, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!","OH.  MY.  GOD.!!!  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!  BEWARE!!! Do not buy anything from this rip-off company!!!  I ordered 8 items from ASOS for my daughter for Christmas gifts.  I placed my order on October 29, 2018, and I specifically asked about their extended return policy for Christmas gifts.  They told me there would definitely be an extended return policy, but that it had not been posted on their website yet.  So, of course, I thought there would be no problem if we needed to return something that didn't fit.  HOWEVER, as it turns out, in order to return something under their Christmas return policy, your order had to be placed on or after November 1, 2018.  I placed my order three days before that date.  But I had no way of knowing that I was placing my order too early!  They should have told me that, especially since I told them the situation and asked about it.  They will not make any exceptions at all!  So, I can tell that at least one item is going to be too big, but I'm stuck with it!  Of course, they said I could send it back and then the warehouse would decide if I would get a refund.  Now why would I do that?  I am not sending anything back unless I'm guaranteed a refund!  That's just crazy!  And my customer service rep, Tania, was like talking to a robot!  We did this over chat.  She just kept saying the same thing over and over again and was not helpful at all!  Basically, all she kept saying was that there was nothing she could do because that's their policy.  She did not answer any questions that I asked either!  Just horrible!  I told her if she did not resolve this issue to my satisfaction that I would NEVER buy anything from ASOS EVER AGAIN and that I would post terrible, negative reviews about ASOS.  She did not seem to care at all.  I also asked to speak to a manager or someone above her.  She said everyone is trained the same way and will tell me the same exact thing.  I told her that a good, decent company that wants to keep its customers would make an exception under the circumstances.  No response.  So then I looked at the reviews, and it was no surprise that ASOS has horrible reviews!  Wish I had looked at them before!  Clearly, ASOS does not care at all about their customers!

No s£@t Sherlock. It makes no difference clearly to this company if you’ve been a regular good  customer- Maddison her name was, didn’t have the courtesy to even bother telling me whether it’s policy or not to offer discount on faulty/used items.

Nariece Solomon,2019-07-12T07:55:08Z,Seriously gone downhill so many issues:,"Seriously gone downhill so many issues:

- Ordered shoes and been sent tights. Is no one checking what’s being sent out?

- Use of terrible couriers, so despite paying for the annual next day delivery it’s not guaranteed 

- Foundation being received with no hygiene seal...OR LID!

By far the worst thing is their returns process. I tend to put all my items into one package and somehow I only get refunded for ONE ITEM. It then takes weeks/months of chasing to get the rest of your money. 

Clearly ASOS weren’t prepared for the growth they’ve had. A company of their size should have clear, defined processes that work. They should have proper customer service with people you can actually talk to over the phone, why is social media the only way of contacting them. They care about the reputation on social media but they don’t actually care about the customers who give them their hard earned money. Sort it out!",1,ASOS,2

The dress was to supposed to arrive July 9th and it is no where to be seen. The tracking information has not updated since it left the warehouse. I contacted them numerous times and each time they tell me I have to wait until a different date before they can do anything - July 29th, July 31st, August 2nd, August 6th. I explained my party is on August 4th and I need my dress but they don't care. I asked them to send a replacement dress and they refused to do anything because they ""have to follow certain processes"". It's absolutely absurd. I will now have to look for a new dress elsewhere with almost no time left thanks to ASOS. Never ever purchasing from them again. I just wish I'd read the reviews before making my purchase.",1,ASOS,2

They messed up my order yet I have to wait for them to refund my money and no option of even trying to fix the fact that they sent me the incorrect item. That’s like going to the grocery store buying a pint of ice cream and getting home and finding out it’s mashed potatoes, so you call them (although ASOS don’t do phones) and tell them “hey I paid for ice cream” and they say “just come all the way back to the store and we’ll mail you a check in 45 days or when we feel like it and hopefully the ice cream you paid for originally will still be there for you to purchase all over again, and hopefully it’s not mashed potatoes again” I feel like good customer service is when a company treats you the way they wanna be treated.

Laura,2019-06-24T17:13:05Z,Thinking of buying from ASOS? Maybe think again...,"I've been an ASOS customer for years, and despite quite a few issues cropping up I've remained loyal. 
I ordered a small item and paid a minimal amount for standard delivery, totalling around £12. I thought something was a bit odd as the ASOS order page didn't change to 'we've sent it!' as it normally does when an order has been dispatched. So on the day of delivery I contacted ASOS via their online chat facility and asked what was happening: the first guy I spoke to said the order had definitely been dispatched, and that I should just wait. There was a lot of cut-and-paste going on. The second person I spoke to gave me a tracking number for Hermes and said that, although there appeared to be some delay, the order would definitely arrive by the end of the day. Much later on that day the Hermes tracking app was still showing 'there's a delay...' and so I contacted ASOS again via the chat facility, and experienced one of the most blunt and rude customer service interactions I've ever had (mixed in with yet more cut-and-paste customer service spiel, the exact same spiel as earlier, word for word). I was told to go away in no uncertain terms, and so I put in a complaint via email to their customer services department.
Overnight the Hermes tracking app updated to show the ASOS order supposedly left the depot, and then it went straight back to the depot a few hours later. It didn't even leave the vicinity of ASOS. This has actually happened before, about a year ago. So I tried to log on to see if the order info had changed in my ASOS account, and was met with a page stating that my account was blocked due to 'suspicious activity'. When I managed to speak to someone at ASOS about this I was told that my account was being closed and that if the parcel ever did show up at their depot then it would take a further 7-10 days to process a refund, and I might receive the money eventually. Of course I can't check on the refund because I no longer have access to my account. 
Being made out to be some sort of fraudster acting in a suspicious, illegal manner has been really upsetting for me. I'm still a bit gobsmacked that this has happened, as I've never come across anything like this before. The order was a small treat for myself because I've been really unwell lately, and it's turned into a complete debacle.
I have never been so disappointed in a company. I just really hope that someone from their Head Office takes the time to look at all of these negative reviews - let's face it, we can't all be wrong! - and tries to change the way ASOS does things.",1,ASOS,2

Package arrived with 4 missing items; an e-mail informed me 3 days after they arrived that the missing items had gone out of stock. How do they even let someone order 4 items that aren’t even there?! And wait Over a week to inform them?! 
Customer service gives the same vague and unhelpful copy and paste answer each time I reach out. I’m constantly made to feel that they could not care less about their customers. The fact that I’ve been a very loyal customer for years, spending thousands, makes all of this even more infuriating. 

I hope they fix their issues soon",1,ASOS,2
Abdul Hoque,2019-05-31T14:42:40Z,Poor customer service!,"I ordered three jumpers from ASOS with a 20% discount code but needed to exchange 2 of them for size as they were gifts and I got the sizes wrong. I spoke to someone on the live chat feature and was told that the best option would be to return and then order them again as there was a 20% code active on that day too. When I got the email confirming my return, I could see that they weren’t sending the full refund I was entitled to because the “refund” (even though I wanted an exchange and was advised to go through this route instead) meant that the total of my original order had dropped to £90 and the original 20% code was only for purchases over £100. 

The easiest option to resolve my issue was simply send me the extra money I am owed but instead, ASOS want me to return the original jumper and then order it again (there is another 20% offer today) which just seems ridiculous to me. I tried speaking to someone on live chat but this person called “Freddie” was extremely rude and closed the chat before I was even finished. I then called ASOS and this advisor (who actually had some customer service skill) said he would refer my case to the Escalations team and they would call me back today. Still awaiting this call but I don’t have a lot of hope and will probably have to go through the hassle of returning my original jumper, order the same one again (at delivery cost to ASOS) and essentially waste a whole load of time and effort on mine and ASOS part..",1,ASOS,2

They said they will resolve and apologised. However, If they ship today 31.05.19 they say i will not receive the item until Friday June 7th. I am away on that day for a trip and i have asked if they could ship it quicker for me.  They have said no. The funny thing is, if i make a purchase from their site today, i will have the items within 3/4 days, sooner to what i am being offerer, for their mistake. Why is this fair or acceptable?

I have now been asked to wait until the 3rd June.. up until today (31st may) I have not received any dispatch email. I then stupidly went and re-ordered one of the items using the next day delivery service costing me 20euros extra because I needed the item for an occasion tomorrow (2nd june).

I ordered an item to be delivered to my current address but their website changed it to an old address which I obviously don't live at anymore.  The package was supposedly delivered and signed for by the person at said address so I decided to go and check for myself, SHOCK there was no package at any of the houses along that street.

Barnaby at ASOS was extremely rude and showed no willingness to help either get the item sent to the correct address or issue a refund.

Barnaby kept asking me to go and collect the parcel from the address it was delivered despite telling him/her 4 times that the item is nowhere to be seen at any address.

I am now out of pocket and still no step closer to getting a resolution.

I will no longer use ASOS and advise the many customers I know not too as well.

They advertise what appears to be a seamless experience as far as their return and refund policy which couldn't be further than the truth! I had faced an issue with their system which for some reason was not properly sharing information or requests with their chosen delivery courier and each time I spoke to a customer agent, they seemed to understand less about their own operations and return process than I did and I'm the customer! At one point, the agent I was chatting with began insinuating that it was my problem even through the error was in their own system and its integration with their delivery partner. In addition, the fact that they do not have a call center clearly shows that they have no interest in investing in customer satisfaction. Needless to say, the entire experience is one that makes it not worth shopping on this website. There are far better and much more developed companies out there that you can directly shop online from without having to feel like you're responsible for their own mistakes!",1,ASOS,2

I am not in any way a liar and I am extremely disappointed with the situation. The items may be elsewhere in the delivery network but they have done nothing to check this and have placed sanctions on my account that are uncalled for, unexpected and downright unfair.

What the f happened to ASOS?

And of course the customer service is terrible, only scripted answers and if they're pushed in the corner they sign off. I mean I would love to know if there's a problem with an item I ordered (availability etc.), or a problem with the warehouse, or anything to be honest. I would love to know a reason for the delay. But no! They tell me to just wait! And if the date they provide passes they tell me to check with my neighbours or check safe places. They don't deliver parcels in Greece without first making sure you're at home to receive it! They don't leave it laying like that! I've even called the delivery service and they can't find the order in their system. 

I filed a claim with PayPal, I hope I'll get my money back or until then, my order. 

The thing is I ordered a backpack which costed 14 euros while I was in Brussels during Christmas and I had a problem with the delivery and then the costumer service was just fine, they refunded and everything. What happened from Christmas till now?",1,ASOS,2

Had my first issue in November 2016 where my parcel was never delivered, just sent back to ASOS and refunded. Messaged them - this got ignored.
Called them, waited 45 minutes on the line and then the agent answered and hung up.
Never bothered contacting them again.

Next issue January 19th I ordered 14 dresses totalling £411 as they were on sale and I wanted to pick 2 for weddings I had throughout the year.
Package arrived with only 6 dresses inside. Called DPD who asked if the parcel looked damaged. It did, it had DPD tape on it.
He advised me to contact ASOS so they could open an investigation.

Contacted Asos at least 6 times over the space of nearly a month. I always had to chase them for an update after their promised times. I couldn’t understand why I was left out of pocket for dresses that they had lost. This should be dealt with between ASOS and the delivery company, having no customer impact.

I was left £411 out of pocket for 3.5 weeks as they “couldn’t do anything until the investigation with DPD was concluded”.
After me hounding then again, they just refunded the money for the missing dresses.

I then received an email after the refund as procsssed to say that they checked stock for the missing dresses and don’t have any of them in my size anymore. THEY HAD LISTED THE WRONG DRESSES. 
I checked myself and some of the dresses were in stock.

I explained this to an agent over email twice who replied with the exact same answer and the exact same list of dresses. I asked to complain to which I was told “we don’t have a complaints process or managers”. I replied again that this was ludicrous and I got no response and my case was shut down.

It’s now the 14th of March and I am STILL waiting on my refund of the other dresses which I returned. Still £116 out of pocket due to their incompetence.

The only thing good about them is the clothes. If you ever have an issue while ordering expect to NOT have it resolved. 3 times in one day I’ve tried to make an order from both my account and my husband’s account to NO avail. Contacted customer service expecting to at least  be given a reason as to why my order keeps getting cancelled and all they can tell me is “ you’ll receive an email in 24 hours”.

My parcel was due to be delivered on the 27th of December and it is now the 28th of December and there is no sign of my parcel. Their customer care has now told me that my parcel could either be delivered on the 30th of December or the 2nd January.

I’m so disappointed that a service which was so highly recommended has let me down and want to warn others about their late delivery, even if you paid extra.",1,ASOS,3
Tyrone Smiley,2019-12-20T16:10:36Z,THREE MONTHS LATER I AM STILL BANNED…,"THREE MONTHS LATER I AM STILL BANNED FROM ASOS AFTER ONE OF MY ITEM WAS STOLEN NO REFUND OR REPLACEMENT HAVE BEEN GIVEN!

ASOS works with DPD delivering company who delivers their items. I had a pair of trainers which was stolen by a driver, I was not present at home to confront the driver on my  tampered packaging.

When I came home to my parcel it had holes at the back of the packaging which was resealed with the ASOS reaseable tape.  I presume the driver poked holes into the packaging to check what was on the receipt, when he saw what was on the receipt the driver opened up the parcel and took the trainers out and re-sealed the packaging. 

When I emailed ASOS with photo evidence on what had happened they told me I would receive an email within 24 hours in regards to my order.

When I received the email it stated it is rare for their items to go missing, therefore they would not deal with the issue and I should contact my bank for a refund. I called multiple times to speak to a manager in regards to this case the first person who I spoked to said I would receive a phone call within 48 hours. When I contacted the ASOS customer care team in regards to speaking to a manager they said due to my case a manager will not be able to speak to me I tried to plead with the customer care team in regards to speaking to a manager to deal with this situation, the customer care team had little care and told me it's out of her hands and I would need to speak to my bank in regards to a refund.

ASOS do not care about their customers they rather label their loyal customers as theifs instead of dealing with their complaints. It's a pity ASOS works in partnership with a untrustworthy company such as DPD. Three months have gone by I have yet to receive an apology or a refund for my missing product also I am Banned from ASOS from making a complaint about my item being stolen!",1,ASOS,3

Disgusting is an understatement! Despite having screenshots of the previous description they’ll just ignore you and say it’s a mistake and get over it! No email with confirmation after a live chat is ended. Ridiculous and disgusting customer service.
Literally you pay a money for a product and ends up being charged for an air in a bag, when you trying to claim a missing items from a parcel, make sure you’re ready to be ignored for long time and then they’ll do everything to prove that you’re not entitled to it.

Michelle,2019-12-19T20:20:30Z,Thanks Asos for the Christmas stress,"Early November I started planning what gifts to purchase for family and friends using the Asos app saved items functionality I’ve used successfully over over 10 years (I’m a massive fan of Asos and must have spent thousands of pounds over the years) I waited until the regular Black Friday offers and on 29th November I ordered a number of items to the value of £238. I eagerly awaited my items to be delivered. On Tuesday 10th I receive an email from ASOS stating they have refunded me £238, then on Wednesday I receive an email to say “your order is on its way”. Slightly confused I try to find how to contact someone to ask what is happening here as I’ve now spent 12 days waiting for my order to be delivered (I would like to add in past years I’ve never waited as long for orders as I have this year- the delay in ordered being received across this year has been disappointing)

I contact a very responsive twitter customer service team on Wednesday who after a number of messages can only apologise as they aren’t sure why the order has been randomly cancelled. The only suggestion I receive is feel free to order them again, this isn’t an option for a number of reasons 
- Many items now out of stock
- Not being sold at the low price Black Friday prices I officially purchased for
- With delivery being so slow I won’t get these in time for Christmas now

After my messages backwards and forwards I’m simply told they can’t do anything as they’ve refunded me!

I’m so disappointed especially as I’m now going to have to sacrifice time with my 4 year old once I’m finally finished work for Christmas to go out last minute shopping and probably now spend far more than I had planned.

DPD have treated me like absolute trash, running a half hearted investigation into the false “safe place” request that did not come from myself, refusing to open another (after ASOS initially did not provide them with screenshots I sent on December 4th - day of delivery) cutting off my calls and denying their culpability. Last night Deniz from the ASOS customer care team agreed my case was worthy of reopening an investigation, attempted to ring DPD and was hung up on 3 times. 

Your colleague then suggested I go straight to my card holder as this was worthy of a refund.

My card holder has now also agreed I absolutely have a case due to all the screenshots but has said the refund will need to come from ASOS and will take up to 3 weeks to process. So I am trying one last time to implore you to take away the middle man and honour my rights in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Your customer care team have agreed I am in the right 

My card holder has told me I am in the right 

I KNOW I am in the right. 

I IMPLORE you to honour your contract with ME as the consumer and not just treat this like a stock standard case of DPD getting away with crappy service.

If not, i will continue my case with my card holder in which I have been assured I will get my money back in due time however I ask that instead you honour my rights, value my 5 years of loyalty, believe me and refund this order or you have sadly lost a customer forever. 

Thank you

Been a customer for many years but customer service is so bad when there is a problem they do not care nor fix it. I ordered an item which arrvied faulty. Asos would not do anything about it just told me to send it back for an exchange. So I did. I then got refunded the item, when it was still in stock the whole time. I didn't want a refund I wanted the item ordered specifically for an event. They refused to re send it. Told me to re order. I did not wish to do this paying for delivery again. In the end I never got the bag. Asos do not care about customers and did not compensate me and offered a poor 10% off future orders which is a joke, especially so as I get that for student discount anyway, so they offered me nothing. They do not quality check items nor resolve complaints. You are better off going to primark. A few weeks prior I ordered some earrings which arrvied broken. They were refunded without issue but there was no apology and the bag was never replaced. 2 faulty items in a row. Disgraceful. Highly disappointed from assos.",1,ASOS,3

I love shopping at ASOS and buy clothes from them at least once a month. While I have rarely ever had issues with the clothes , recently the customer service has been awful. They have introduced Facebook messenger and the waiting time is crazy. I accidently put my old address down for my order and I have no idea where the TrakPak depot is, the local post office say they don't have it but here in Melilla there's no other site. I got no answer about the depot from ASOS despite stating that it's time sensitive . so it looks like all the items I bought in the sale will be returned, great!",1,ASOS,3

I place three order that day and only that didn't go through with regards to the free delivery.

Steve,2019-11-29T11:49:16Z,Customer service disappointing,"For such a big organisation, I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed with the customer service.

As a new customer I ordered costly items and paid via vouchers obtained through a work scheme (7% discount). Did it via the vouchers due to the discount but had to order the vouchers first before placing an order so was considerably out of pocket to start with.

Placed the order and paid the small balance via PayPal and received confirmation of the payment. Never received confirmation of the order from asos. Followed it up the following day and my account stated that no orders present. I followed this up with an email and no response for several hours. Contacted live chat and they couldn't deal with it and forward an email to another team. I was told it could be 24 hours before I get a response. Likely to be over the weekend so I was not expecting any reply until the following week.

In the meantime I don't know if the order had been placed or not. I run the risk of it going out of stock and being left with vouchers that I ordered to get a discount.

Poor customer service. I suppose that's the risk of online shopping, but I expected better from a large organisation.",1,ASOS,3

Good luck to you if you ever have an issue as you will receive automated generic responses from people who aren't interested at all.

I replied asking again for a track and trace that worked, customer service replied stating to wait to get in touch until Oct 8, when the package was supposed to be delivered, to which I replied asking if the delivery was supposed to happen on the 5 or 8, as the information was confusing.

Customer service replied stating that it was set to be delivered on Oct 5 and for me to wait to inquire about it only after that. Besides that, customer service tells me to edit my delivery information, despite it being accurate. No delivery attempt on Oct 5 and track and trace STILL doesn’t work.

This is because in the last month, their courier Hermes have constantly been not delivering my parcels and having what seems like a glitch with my address. I asked ASOS to contact Hermes as a) Hermes are uncontactable b) they make you speak only through the retailer eg ASOS c) the glitch means I have no idea where the parcel is and when it will come d) every other retailer has happily contacted Hermes on my behalf to request to know where the parcel is. On the ASOS online chat to Bethany, she informed that they cannot contractually speak to Hermes on my behalf!!!!

I HIGHLY doubt that they are contractually obliged to no contact with their own couriers. They said to allow 6 days for a next day delivery.

E123,2019-10-04T20:12:26Z,Not even worth one star,"Not even worth one star. I had a jacket, within 4 / 5 month it became faulty.  I asked for an exchange instead of this I was given a £115 voucher (the coat coat £135 I originally had a £20 discount). 

The coat was still in stock so I re ordered it but Asos were reluctant to offer me the same £20 discount and didn’t  exchange as I told I could request. It leaves me to think that they do this deliberately to gain an additional £20. 

The second coat arrived (exactly the same product) with no tags. I wore it once and noticed it smelt of someone else’s perfume. When I took the coat off I noticed this one was also faulty!!! Do they not check the items they send out?? 

I have been in contact on the live chat multiple times and by email. I’ve spoken to over 8 people at Asos (the same person never replies to the email thread). All as unhelpful as each other. I’ve been told different things each time I’ve had a reply. One person told me I should have had a refund to my card as the item was faulty not a voucher. 

I’ve now received another voucher for the second faulty coat but this is only for £109.05?!? They have then tried to tell me that the £6.95 reduction is for next day delivery despite me already paying for this with my card?!?!? Which I can prove. 

It’s an absolute joke and I am so angry!! I’ve been on the live chat tonight & they have told me yet again that they had read through my previous chats...and have no come the conclusion that I should have been given a refund. This has been going on since the beginning of September it’s now been passed to the “specialist team” which has apparently happened before.

One ASOS agent advised me that due to technical difficulties, the parcel is not traceable. Another agent told me the parcel is just delayed for one day (it’s been a week), some other told me it wasn’t shipped yet and to top it off, 4 different agents give me 4 different dates until which I have to wait before they can do anything.

This is the absolute worst. They only send out automatic replies and give me random dates to have me wait longer.

Customer Service is Terrible!!!

Ordered swimwear for my holidays on the 3rd August 2019.

on the Thursday 8th August I went on the tracking to see where my items were it said there is a delay on your item and we will have it out within the next 24 hours.

I Never received my item, I left the weekend to pass then on the 11th August I spoke with Kristofer from the customer service team who was no help what so ever, the responses and lies are an absolute joke. Basically told me I have to wait until the 20th August until they can do anything, I was raging at this point as tracking was updated on Friday the 9th August stating ' we are unable to deliver your parcel please contact sender' which is what I was doing when speaking to Kristofer. I requested a refund and he just said back to me ' we are unable to issue you a refund as your parcel is in transit to you' What a joke! obviously I had to reiterate the fact hermes stted they are NOT delivering my Parcel so why is he lying to me.

Anyway, I didn't believe him so I called up on Monday 12th August and spoke to another customer service team and they were a little more helpful as they explained the reason I had to wait until the 20th was due to the 'contract' they have with Hermes which is an absolute disgrace of a service! He also told me there is nothing they can do until the 20th August.

Today is the 20th August! I Have just spoken to Arfana and now she is saying I have to wait until the 21st August which is tomorrow. Not really sure what difference a day makes but on two different occasions I was told they couldn't do anything until today and now I am being fobbed off again! Company is a F**king joke. Customer service have no clue what they are talking about clearly!.

And still no Item. Due to go on my holidays 2 items of swimwear down, as well as lost money! Absolutely Raging. 

We will see what there excuse is tomorrow. No doubt they will fob me off with a refund and a little 10/20% discount I mean what a joke of a company! if they think a refund and 10/20% of next order is ok when I have waited nearly 3 weeks for an order they keep trying to tell me is coming.

The agent ended up closing the chat on me without giving me any answers to why this happened or even saying he would try and find out. Barely got an apology either. Worked in customer service myself and the way they have handled this mistake is beyond bad.

It was already late by the day I was going overseas so I contacted their ""customer service"" team to try and organise a return or cancel the delivery as I wouldn't be home within their return period. First person was difficult to deal with so I asked him to transfer me to someone else, which he refused saying ""you will get the same answer from them"". He then cancelled the chat while I was still talking, so I tried again and placed a complaint, second person was slightly more reasonable, but due to ASOS' stupid customer service policy she was useless too. After sending in a complaint, I received an email from customer service (not even manager) saying that they stand by the first persons decision to not transfer me. I don't give a duck if they tell me the same thing, I should be able to speak to another person if the person I'm talking to is dealing with the situation unsatisfactorily without being obstructed.

I placed an order for next day delivery on the 12/11. I was informed my parcel was delivered to the Collect + store on the 13/11. On the 14/11 I went to collect the order and was informed by the store that ASOS had requested a return of the parcel and it was collected that afternoon to be returned? I never requested a return and so contacted ASOS who had no idea why. I requested the resend me out the items next day as I needed them ASAP and they ""helpfully"" informed me the only way to sort this would be to order the items (and pay for them of course) again. The order was over £120 which makes it an atrocious procedure. I was informed I would receive a full refund once my ""return"" was processed. 

Fast forward 3 weeks after my holiday and I notice I still havent received any refund or update from ASOS. When I click to view my order status it simply shows as ""shipped"" so I get in touch with ASOS who advise they still dont know where my parcel is? 

I checked the delivery tracking info and it says it was returned to ASOS on 19/11 (6 days after it already wasnt at the collection location) and there is no update since. This means that its been 22 days since I placed the order and I still dont have any order or my money back.

If you have a car accident your insurance pays for it and then chases the other car for money, if the courier loses an item it should be the same. The customer should not be made to pay. Allowing Hermes 2 weeks to find an item is an agreement ASOS have with Hermes, not me, and they did not state this anywhere on their website. Yes of course allow a delivery company one or 2 days extra, but 2 weeks? And then i have to start the process again.

Short version:
I ordered a dress worth £99 in November 
I never received the dress
ASOS won’t comminicate with me or take any responsibility so I’m not being refunded

Long version:

I ordered three items including a dress for £99. When I got the items the dress wasn’t in the package, the package looked like it had been split. 

I told ASOS and they said they were looking into and would get back to me within 4 days.

4 days later I’d heard nothing, so I emailed again they said it would take 5 days.

5 days later I’d still heard nothing so I emailed again. They said they need to launch an investigation with DPD. I said I wanted my money back as I have nothing to do with DPD and they didn’t reply. 

A week later I emailed again asking for money back. They said they needed to wait to hear back from DPD?? So I asked if there was a time limit, ‘for example, if you don’t hear back from DPD for a year, will I still be waiting for my money back?’ Surprise Suprise...no reply.

Therefore I have had to contact them on each occasion to request the full, correct refund amount. 

Empty, standard apologies received however no genuine apology or explanation. Indeed, instead of focusing on the issue one member of staff took great lengths to write about my upcoming birthday and encouraged me to make further orders!!

I have asked for an explanation as to why they are sending out partial refunds. They are quick enough to charge the full amount to your card when you order, despite taking days to process and despatch the order. Received some nonsense about processing items separately, even though it was the same order and items I had returned were in the same parcel as those which I had already received a refund for.

Asked for a manager to contact me and again asked for an explanation. Completely ignored.

My last order came with gaping holes in the bag, big enough for items to fall out. They can’t blame the courier as when opened the order the despatch note inside was in 3 pieces because of the lack of care whoever packed it has taken.

Final order has been sent back. Account will be closed as soon as I have my refund.

Do not trust them on delivery dates","I ordered some lounge wear a week ago and they took 3 days to dispatch my order despite it coming up to Christmas. Despite on the email my delivery would occur by December 20th, it's not come still. When I contacted customer service, they told me my order wouldn't be delivered until at least New Years Day!!! Disgusting considering I've ordered over a week before Christmas as a gift.

Found the customer service to be rude and unwilling to refund me at least my delivery charges but doubt I will get anything! If they were genuine they'd have stated on their website that delivery in time for Christmas was not guaranteed. 

Really disappointed and won't be buying from them ever again.

Lee Chapman,2018-12-21T20:15:40Z,I am very unhappy with all the lies… Christmas Gifts Not coming,"I am very unhappy with the level of service that I have received from ASOS and DPD, so I will review for both, I share this with you as I have just been sent an email from ASOS with lies. I will inform you of what I have so far experienced.

I ordered Christmas gifts for my daughter from ASOS and designated my click and collect location.

 I am a Police Office working for the MET so I am limited on time due to dealing with criminals so click and collect is the obvious choice. Clearly not the case.

After dealing with my arrest and case papers I Headed over to My click and collect location, as I received a message saying it had been signed for. However it was not there and was never sent there.

After spending an age on the phone trying to get through to customer service I found out that the package is in BARKING ( WHY?) so I said I would collect it. I was then told that I could not as my name is not on the packages, DPD saying ASOS messed up. (was that also a lie? Was it even there?). Even though the  lady I spoke too was looking at my details on a computer screen knowing what my name is along with the reference number that is on the screen in front of her I would not be able to collect it.  

Time out.........

Logic, initiative, common sense, think outside the box........ Put my name on the box..... Screen in front says my name. I ordered it. It is for the said name on the screen. I am that person, get a pen and put my name on the package........... The Ref number is on the screen  and is linked to my name. 

Ok Logic is gone from this world. Too much time on phones, who knows turning into mindless robots.

Long story short Dpd blame ASOS, ASOS blame DPD. I don't like playing the blame game, why don't they just talk to each other. 

As I was dealing with a Policing matter so I asked the lady from DPD nicely and calmly for her to email me with a solution as all I want to do is pick up my xmas gift for my daughter. She said she would email me at the email address that she had... and guess what?  yes under my name,I thanked her for her help, did she email me back that day? No. 

They are still blaming each other and not one has come up with a solution. 

I do not recommend ASOS or DPD.",1,ASOS,3

ASOS directed me to dpd and dpd bounced me back to Asos. I finally got an email saying that the collection point I had chosen was either no longer trading, closed or didn’t accept dpd parcels anymore! After many, many more live chat conversations I managed to get the order shipped back to Asos for a refund, as I was no longer in London by this point so had no way of picking it up from anywhere.

Nothing, nada, zilch. “It’s not in our policy” well I think you need to change your policy and your customer care because it’s just plain awful.

Ordered shoes for an event with next day delivery, the DPD delivery driver called Marlon didn't bother coming at my door while I was in waiting patiently for the scheduled delivery, next thing I received an email confirming that the parcel was delivered and signed by someone else whereas no first attempt was made and I repeat I was in.

 Upon calling customer services and complaining about the fact that I needed it resolved ASAP because I was going to a work event and the shoes where in that parcel, an agent called Gilly with the worst attitude told me that they won't do anything about it and that it was okay according to terms and conditions if the driver doesn't deliver to the customer but make the decision to leave the parcel in what he believes is a ""safe place"". What is the point to take people's address and stop drop the parcel elsewhere!!! Basically, they support lazinessof the driver but we pay for next day delivery then we have to locate the parcel ourselves while they are happy to charge you without fulfilling the deal. Absolutely disgusting way of treating the customer. On top of that, she was very condescending, dismissive and literally paused the conversation then asked me what was my question again? Nobody is willing to help and instead they repeat the same thing and end the conversation with """"we can't do anything about it, anything else I can help you with?""

Leonie Smith,2019-04-02T16:18:26Z,There is no customer service.,"There is no customer service.

I tracked my delivery online until I was the next delivery, stood by the doorbell, and then the screen refreshed and just said that the driver couldn’t access my property. Contacted ASOS via chat and explained. The robotic Daniel said that nobody had been home to sign (despite me having already explained the situation). Clearly untrue. I was literally stood by the doorbell waiting because I was the next delivery on the online tracker. I asked Daniel to speak with the delivery company to find out why they said nobody home (maybe they have the wrong address?) - he refused. I asked Daniel to escalate to a manager or to their complaints team (maybe they have the authority to speak to the delivery company?) - he refused. Daniel told me that there is nobody else in the whole of ASOS that anything can EVER be escalated to or passed on to. Apparently nobody can ever speak to the delivery company to find out what’s happening either. Then when I repeated that it was false that nobody was home and asked again to escalate, Daniel changed the story from ‘nobody there to sign for it’ to ‘well, there might be lots of reasons why the driver couldn’t deliver’. I’m not sure what these reasons are, as the street is easy to access, with street parking, and the doorbell is right on the front and definitely working. But presumably, it might be a good idea to ask the driver before he or she attempts redelivery another day?

So, absolutely useless, they couldn’t care less and they will not do anything to actually investigate beyond reading whatever the computer screen says. I’ve spent a lot with ASOS, but every time something goes wrong it’s a mess to speak with them. I think it’s time to kick my ASOS habit.",1,ASOS,3

Honest lacked the understanding of my case to be able to work with me to find the parcel. 

I appreciate that deliveries don’t always run smoothly however when a customer is willing to find the parcel and return it. After ASOS lost the original parcel and I am still working with them to try resolve. 

I have unfortunately after getting nowhere with Sophie written off the clothes. Sophie ended the chat with “as I have advised all I can I will end the chat”. Sophie still hadn’t answered the following questions for me: 
1. Can I return the goods and get a refund 
2. Which items were resent 
3. What number was the parcel delivered too ( the correct number) 
Or actually got me to a resolution so I fail to see how she couldn’t advise me any more. 


She then told me not to ring DHL as they would redirect me back to them however as she lacked the understanding to help me
Just told me to ring them, but why if they will redirect me?? And that’s the last bit of advice I got! 

Anyway long and short it’s pretty poor. I would recommend always getting your parcels delivered to click and collect which I had tried to do and then they resent it out to a home

Nelle R,2019-03-02T05:16:09Z,Be prepared to pay for any mistakes ASOS makes,"As a once faithful ASOS shopper I have witnessed how they have become crappier with each passing year. Years ago they used to have one of the best customer services, free shipping (on U.S. orders) with no minimum (it eventually moved up to a minimum of $25 which I think was still pretty reasonable and now it's at $50), and an awesome selection of decently priced clothes for the quality. This is no longer the case.

Anyway, I made a purchase from them a couple of weeks ago. For my shipping option I chose Click & Collect (which means you can have them send your item to a UPS store and then you can go pick it up when it's delivered there). So I noticed that I never received a notification that my package was ready although it was a couple of days past the expected delivery date. I drove down to the UPS store and they said to come back later as they didn't seem to have much information as to where it was and that maybe the delivery truck would bring it to the store later. Later that day before heading out back to UPS I checked the tracking and it stated ""DELIVERY REJECTED, RETURNING TO SENDER"".  I was completely confused so I called UPS. They stated that ASOS shipped my package with UPS SurePost which does not allow packages to be collected from UPS store but has to be completed with the post office delivering to my home mailbox. Therefore, when my package was delivered to the UPS store it was rejected and returned without me even being notified. UPS told me there was nothing they could do about it and to get in contact with ASOS. I then contacted ASOS in attempt to figure out why they would give me the option of Click & Collect but then send my package with SurePost. They didn't give me an answer. They also stated that they couldn't return the package and that I would have to reorder (annoying since the item was now out of stock). I was a little upset but what really sent me over the edge was their response when I asked if they were also going to refund my shipping. They said they would refund my order but NOT the shipping. I told them that was unacceptable and why if it was their mistake am I not being refunded every single dollar I paid. They stated because the shipping had a tracking number and so it can’t be refunded. So what if it had a tracking number?! YOU incorrectly sent it through the wrong service so again, WHY am I the one being penalized for your mistake? This is the move that hit the final nail in the coffin for me—- they ended the chat lol. Top tier customer service right there. I told them I would never purchase from them again and I mean it.

But the last couple of times I have dealt with them have been extremely disappointing. Either the items were of deplorable quality, fit etc, or the refunds are not given when you send back an item in good faith. And in the last case (that's certainly the last time for me) the item was a warm winter coat with a zipper that doesn't do up. How is that 'fit for purpose'? And getting a refund for the wasted $150? Forget it. Their system didn't even register the purchase in my account, and so they wouldn't give me a returns slip number. I provided all the proof, ie paypal receipt, order number, my id etc, but they just stonewalled me when I tried to get past their BS with facts. What a crazy bunch - if they think they can stay in business that way. I will certainly warn everyone I know that they'd better watch out if anything they order isn't up to scratch - and I think neither ASOS's products nor their returns process is up to scratch. So, basically if you feel like a gamble with your money, buy from ASOS - but if you prefer to know that when you spend money on clothing you are actually going to get what you paid for, then DON'T GO NEAR THEM. Really hopeless and a wonder they're still going really. If I took $150 from someone in the street I would go to jail, but they just get away with it.",1,ASOS,3

I told them that I wanted the leggings but they still instructed me to return them and wait for them to come back in stock to be sent a replacement, which they couldn’t guarantee. Apparently they can’t process a partial refund but they can process a returns refund... they have made this such an ordeal",1,ASOS,3
Practice Test User,2019-03-27T20:52:11Z,Will never shop there again,"Will never shop there again. First, it took almost 3 weeks to ship to me. Secondly, I returned everything but 3 items in my order (almost $150 worth of clothes). They have yet to receive my shipment and are claiming the prepaid shipping label that THEY PROVIDED is not enough for proof of shipment. This is pretty much fraud because no one drops off a package and then asks for proof of postage. I have never had any issues with any other online retailers like this and i use alot. I'm convinced this is how they are covering their expenses by frauding customers out of money.

UPDATE: I went to UPS to try to get ""proof of postage""... although proof of postage (according to UPS) is the tracking number located on the label that ASOS should have access to. Even when I asked their customer service reps to send me the city of their warehouse so I could narrow down some tracking numbers, they refused. Basically, they aren't incentivized to find the return because they rather take my money than keep me as a customer. They are withholding information from me which is by definition fraud: ""Fraud involves the false representation of facts, whether by intentionally withholding important information or providing false statements to another party for the specific purpose of gaining something that may not have been provided without the deception.""

Never shopping there again as I am out $150 and will definitely be returning the other half of my order I was planning on keeping (another $150) due to my poor experience.",1,ASOS,3

I ordered my order June 28th and it arrived July 12th, thats two weeks after. But the late arrival is not the worst part. 
When it hadn’t arrived July 5th as promised, I went on their live chat to hear where it was and I specifically wrote “if it hasn’t left your warehouse, just take it back and give me a refund. I don’t need the dresses anymore”. And the lady so kindly wrote that I wasn’t there and it has been send - which was wired since I haven’t gotten any tracking number or mail about it’s departure - but she told me to wait until the 12th, so I did. 

The 11th I woke up to a mail saying “you’re package has left our warehouse and is on its way to you”. When I go that message I must admit I felt so lied to, she told me they didn’t have it? And when it arrived next day I got the feeling that they first send it after I wrote them. 
So I went on the chat again and complained about the lie. They could have just owned up to the mistake and said “sorry to hear so, here is a compensation or something”. But no no, he wrote “sorry to hear, but there is nothing I can do - you have to sent it back to us”. 

This whole experience has been so disappointing and I must say I am quite furious, sitting back here with no compensation of or explanation on why they lied to me. 

So this is minus 5 stars in my eyes and I will not place an order there one more time.",1,ASOS,3

Chun T,2019-01-19T01:22:51Z,"Incompetent staff, shut customer up when they cannot solve the problem. I thought I was shopping at a Deep Web Merchandise.","I was once a loyal ASOS customer for three years and was on the A-LIST top-tier membership for the entire time until they closed the membership programme earlier this year. 

This year I purchased next-day delivery service, and this has proven as one of the greatest mistakes I have ever made.

Spending £9.99 for the so called 'Next-day delivery' and have two deliveries out of three never arrived on the next day. Contacted customer service online and all that I received were copy-and-paste canned templates that were irrelevant.

And then this staff, who referred herself as 'Imani', should be awarded the best employee of ASOS. I witnessed the best way to deliberately shut customer up when there is anything out of competency :

'As I have advised all I can I will now go ahead and close the chat.'

Unbelievable.

I was in the Customer Service sector and I can admit that I once thought I was talking to scammers here. All that I have experienced have violated the big no-nos of the CS profession. I am shocked to see a big e-commerce like ASOS would allow such service standard as if I was in a random deep web merchandising.

To ASOS management (if there is even one) - I do not know how much you paid your online CS that made them treat customers like that - Hopefully not, but I wouldn't be surprised, if the people I was speaking with were some high school part-time who did not even know how to deal with problems in the real world of work.",1,ASOS,3

I have had an ongoing dispute with ASOS since July 2018 and it still is not resolved. They have scammed me for £545.00. I ordered several items from them on June 30th and when they delivered my parcel no one was at home, so rather than leaving a note to re-arrange the delivery or leaving it at the post office they left it with my neighbour without my permission. Firstly this is against consumer rights. Secondly I received no text/ note to let me know my parcel was left with my neighbour, until my neighbour knocked on my door to give me the parcel. When I received the parcel from my neighbour, firstly it was a lot smaller than I had expected and secondly items were missing. Now I trust my neighbour and the package was fully sealed, therefore I know my neighbour had not taken any items but my most expensive items were not delivered. I had received goods worth £55 and the remaining items were missing. I have called ASOS several items about this, I have contacted my bank and raised a dispute, however ASOS refused to give the money bank. I have also spoken to Citzen's advise and sent ASOS letters and emails with no reply. This company is the worst to order from, they claim they have closed my case and no one will speak/ answer me.

I spent over 1000$ in 2 weeks with this company and all good until one day they suddenly close my account when I ordered a GoPro, they did not even ask for more info about me in case it was a verification failure.
Then, after hours of waiting to get a different reply from ""our specialist team will check"", they CHARGED my second account used for GoPro order, then blocked the account, and nobody knows anything about the status of the order which probably will never come. 
Nobody can answer me, nobody can do anything, their ""specialist team"" is checking for 3 days already (for sure not).",1,ASOS,3
Lucy,2019-05-24T12:20:18Z,Be Wary of Misleading Prices and Discounts!,"I used a 20% student discount for an order totalling £229.00. When you place your order you receive an e-mail that displays each item you ordered at their full unit price and the discount is deducted at the end of the order total. I paid £197.75 which works out as a discount of 13.65%, which can't be right.

I queried this with their online chat because I returned some of the items and I couldn't work out if I was being refunded the correct amount. The person I spoke to online, Marilyn, was extremely rude and cagey and refused to give me these numbers. She told me she ""calculated them using maths"" and ended the chat on me without solving my query.

Well, I've used the same maths to calculate my discount and the numbers don't add up.

After making contact with the company, and speaking with Richard from ASOS, a refund on one of the dresses was made after much trouble, but the other was sent.
When the dress arrived it did not fit, so a return label was ordered and the package was shipped the same day. Now almost three weeks after, still no refund of the second dress, they refuse to chat and require e-mails to be sent to them validating identity, despite doing so, it's still not sufficient, so we still chat (since they have no phones apparently) with ASOS, or that might too much to say, since they reject chatting and continue closing the chat whenever we refer to older chats and reference and order numbers and request a refund for the second dress...

If they leave it with the neighbour - they don’t write down the house number so I need to knock on people’s doors until I find my parcel. But that’s something that I could go around. Now, last couple of experiences were so frustrating - for the start, I was missing the item from my order, after I’ve pointed that out, they’ve sent the new pair of shoes but I never got those as well so had to conatact them AGAIN about my situation. Fine. It happens. Let’s go on. I bought 2 dresses and 1 didn’t fit me so I’ve returned it. Waited for them to confirm they’ve received the item - NOTHING. Had to chat with them AGAIN. They’ve refunded me. Fine. Still can handle it. Ordered dress and it didn’t fit me. Returned it , but only to have another, just in different size. Got the email this morning claiming I will be refunded. Contacted them AGAIN, guy is telling me I was refunded because it wasn’t in stock just an hour ago but it’s in stock now so I can make a purchase again (yeah right, and to pay for a new postage). After I told him I had so many negative experiences with ASOS lately he replied they almost never make errors and that this is a rare case and if that’s all I needed today that I can close the chat. That’s the way you treat customers, well done! Clearly there is so many incompetent people lately working with ASOS which is such a shame as I LOVED shopping with them and spent hundreds (if not thousands) of pounds there. Well, they won’t see my pennies ever again. Seeing all these negative comments really made me think that people who work there are actually sabotaging the company.",1,ASOS,3
Stephen,2019-01-10T08:27:22Z,Rude and incompetent customer services staff,"It would be great to see ASOS improve their consistency in the customer service. All I was looking for was a member of the ASOS team to re-arrange a delivery with their delivery provider (Gnewt), after one my packages was sent to the incorrect address which I picked by mistake. 

Firstly, using the online chat portal, I had to get in contact three times in one day for the following reasons:

The first time (Friday 4th) it created a chat box with my old email, even though I was logged into my account with my current email. This might be a cookie refresh issue. I was told to log out and create a new ticket with my new email, even though I could fully provide any authentication on my end.
The second time, having logged out and made a query passing my email in, I was told I'd get a phone call to assist me with my problem (arranging a re-delivery with Gnewt). I never got called.
The third time, a few hours after I was told I'd be called, I got in contact again and received the same response, that I would be getting a phone call. I never got called.

On Sunday, I then decided to get in contact with the social media CS (Facebook messenger), where my chat history is visible to read through by your team. I was told without a chat reference I could not be helped, which somewhat defeats the point in having a customer services portal on Facebook at all. When asked whether I could create a new query (and ignore the previous experiences on Friday), I was replied to with a copy-paste response of what was said before, essentially dismissing my response. It was rude, unhelpful and made me feel ignored and disrespected as a customer, especially as one paying for their next-day delivery service.

Only after submitting a feedback claim that evening illustrating my frustration did I get help, which was actually solved very quickly on Monday. That was very helpful, although it made me wonder why that could not have been done first thing on Friday, rather than make me go through what I went through over the weekend. My request was not complicated, and easy to resolve, and yet it took 3 online CS staff, who knows how many Facebook Messenger CS staff and one official feedback submission to get someone on your end to action my query. This is pretty terrible on ASOS' end, and means I won't be renewing my next-day subscription as I ultimately had the experience of someone who had a delayed and problematic delivery with terrible support.

The solution to my problem was not complex, and yet it took an insane amount of effort to resolve. I was unable to edit the order as the 15-minute window to edit next-day orders had elapsed by the time I realised I had picked the wrong address (ordered some other stuff to the correct address later that day). If ASOS are going to be cutting off order edits after that short window maybe I'd recommend they ensure their CS system has basic competency to handle issues like this in the future.",1,ASOS,3

Rebecca Pietryga,2019-12-31T13:29:18Z,I'm the bad one even though they never sent me my Promised ‘promo code’...laughable.,"Honest Review from ex-loyal customer:

Shopped with ASOS for years but recently had an issue with them. Bought a dress, was too big so sent it back for an exchange and the item was in stock the whole time. They gave me a full refund instead. I contact them asking why they cannot give me the dress in the smaller size because it is in stock so what’s the issue? Told only thing I can do is reorder the dress even though I got it at something like 20% off for a Black Friday deal and now it’s back up to full price. Told them I’m not doing that as if need to spend ‘X amount’ more on the higher price and another delivery. Was told they’d give me 10% discount. Not good enough as this was still about £5 more (minimum) than what I’d originally paid and requested an exchange for. I get an email which was supposed to contain a 15% off (I managed to talk them up to 15%) promo code but they never included the discount code in the email. I go to Facebook message them and tell them all this and they say they’ll give me free delivery but they don’t reply for days/weeks at a time and still don’t sent me the discount code!!!! They then have the cheek to say they followed all policies and procedures but I have NEVER BEEN SENT THE PROMO CODE and for some reason even though I’ve repeated myself multiple times and sent them a screenshot of the email with no promo code in it the ASOS customer care team are too stupid to actually acknowledge this crucial part to my customer care experience. I’ve ‘talked’ to about 5+ people and not one of them acknowledged my messages about not even having been sent the promo code I was promised. Honestly will never buy from them again.",1,ASOS,4

I’ve had occasions when the items don’t come next day, I once waited 14 days for an order and then they sent it back to the warehouse in the end (I didn’t ask them to do that). I currently have an order that was due on the 27th in December and they’re telling me it may or may not come on the 3rd and if it doesn’t to contact them. When things like this happen repeatedly customers should have delivery charge refunded straight away. By the time my order comes I won’t even need it for my event. I don’t mind waiting 5-7 working days if Its standard delivery but if I pay for a service and it’s not fulfilled I should get my money back but ASOS customer service think differently. I’m not one to leave bad reviews but I dread contacting ASOS customer service these days because I know exactly what I’m going to get “sorry, wait however long and if it’s not arrived contact us again...” I’m a regular customer and it’s disappointing to see a company you love not treat you as a valued customer.",1,ASOS,4

Emma Skovgaard Jørgensen,2019-12-20T20:44:14Z,Dissappointing customer service when receiving a wrong item,"I never had problems with ASOS until now. I bought a watch Black Friday, when ASOS had a 25% discount. I received it fast, but to my surprise, they sent another watch. That is unfortunately, but I didn't think it would be a problem as I would just return it, and they could send me the right one, when they received the wrong watch. 

However, that is not how it works at ASOS. I have to return the watch, and then they will return the discounted price (which is fair, so people don't get full refunds and just keep the money), but I will then have to buy the watch again, without the discount. I will therefore have to pay at least 25% extra compared to the price I paid, when I bought it. They could have made a special discount code, just for the watch, so that I could have bought at the same price as when I bought it the first time, but that is not a possibility according to ASOS's customer service who wrote ""Unfortunately, you will have to pay a full price if you still wish to have the watch"". 

It should be ASOS' responsibility to send the right items, but apparently it is my problem - at least it seems so, as ASOS wants me to pay for their mistakes. It is extremely dissapointing - not only receiving the wrong watch, but also not being able to get it at the promised price. 

It is simply just poor customer service - why even write on your webpage, that customers can get a replacement if a wrong item is received if it is not an option?",1,ASOS,4

I've had some of the best shopping experiences with ASOS over the span of 15 years and thousands of pounds spent too. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I have many positive things to say about this company anymore (very Sad)

My recent experience is one I will never forget.

I purchased 4 items on September 10th a leaving present for a lifelong friend going off to uni on the 14th, using a promo code my items qualified for 20% off. (yessss:)

I proceeded with payment, already have the premier service so I arranged to work from home to be avail for next day delivery.

September 11th, 

received my package, which was slightly open only to find that 1 of 4 items were packaged however the delivery note stated that the 4 items were enclosed. Immediately I contacted ASOS and asked for them to find my items or at least let me know when I will be expecting them to arrive (thinking that I might receive an additional delivery to complete the purchase) 

Instead I was refunded minus the discount for the 3 missing items which have been shown as in-stock up to the point of sale and some 24 hours later. I just want my purchases, Was happy to pay back the refund, in exchange for my items as I did not once ask for a refund.

I have requested a formal complaint and I have been ignored.

I have asked asos CC to put right their error as I should not forefiet ASOS mistake, I would like to be in the same place that I was in at the point of sale, nothing more or less I just want my goods. 

I was then offered a discount code providing I spend more than I did on the 10th of September, I just want to be in the same position that I was in on the 10th when I made the purchase. 


asos CC emailed me to say that if I place an order for the missing three items ASOS will refund me the difference so that I am no better or no worse off from my original purchase made on September 10th. Once completed I was asked to provide the order number so that they can refund me the difference. (hallelujah!!! Not....)

asos cc proceeded with further foolery

They stated that they can only apply a discount on items over the value of £125 and as my order does not amount to this I do not qualify for a difference in amount refund. 

What a joke and a complete waste of my time, my consumer rights taken from me breaching the 'consumers right act 2015' I think it's time for asos to face legislative rules as they seem to have none in place. 

They will be reported!!",1,ASOS,4

I messaged in with a faulty item and I was inconveniently asked to return the item for a refund. It has been a while since I had received my refund, so I spoke to someone who asked for my details. I provided these and he said they were incorrect and closed that chat. Prior before asking me to try again or double check them. When I did check they were correct yet they still closed the chat? I then spoke to someone else who told me to wait until the next day. Shock, the next day came and they again told me to wait until the next day and that to reference the chat number and they’ll get it resolved right away ( I sent confirmation of proof of postage). So again I came back, this time in total over three hours trying to get my refund for a fault on Asos part. They told me to resend more proof of postage despite sending it and it being confirmed at fine. I can’t believe the lack of customer support despite clearly being a continuous customer. I’m most disappointed at the inconvenience caused to return a faulty item and the fact my chat was closed for no reason and the general rude and blunt tone of employees.

A retailer who uses a known crime syndicate to deliver their packages (Hermes) should be Boycotted. In order to cut costs, they use Hermes to deliver your package, and it will not arrive 85% of the time.

My latest order summing over £200 was meant to arrive by today, last night at 8pm I get an email telling me Hermes has dropped my package off, there was even a forged signature on the tracking page. 

As you can imagine, no package was delivered. I needed the clothes for an interview I have tomorrow and now I am left without any clothes to wear to the interview and no money to buy anything since these criminals have refused to refund me. They are pretty quick at taking the money from your bank instantly when youre buying but when their criminal delivery company steals your package you have to wait for ASOS ""Specialists"" to look in to your case.

When they came in, one of the items was a little small.  So when I returned and purchased the other size, I was only refunded the value of the item, minus the e50.

Upon contacting customer care, I basically got the same excuse 5 different ways... not sure if it's a machine that churns out the responses coz a person should be able to apply common sense añd logic, to know that I should be refunded the full value of the item. 

The unfortunate thing is that I was lining up to purchase more items from the store but now after this, for the sake of e50 ... they will lose sales from me of €€€, that's why their customer care is useless.",1,ASOS,4

After hours of emailing ASOS and DPD to get this rectified, I was told by ASOS that they had attempted delivery twice, and sorry I had missed it. Beyond infuriating when you are trying to raise a complaint and explain their couriers’ misconduct, however their policy is apparently to blame the customer. Never ordering with them again. 

Also, still not received my delivery, and told by DPD that I will have to collect it now on Monday, due to them having technical issues. Absolute shambles of organisations.",1,ASOS,4

I told them that I would like to keep the shirt and pay for it and they could send me the jacket I purchased because I liked the T-shirt and I couldn’t find it on the site. But in the meantime I read in description of the “jacket” it was indeed a T-shirt (so they made a mistake). He told me that I couldn’t keep the T-shirt and had to repurchase the jacket. I simply asked him politely if that was indeed the jacket that I had purchased and not the T-shirt like I just had read in the description. He told me I quote ‘ it is the jacket.’ If you are a good costumers service you would have told the costumer ‘ one moment I will take a look at it’ but no. After that he didn’t even say a word. I found it out myself. They had 2 times the same pictures and title only with a different price. One was a T-shirt and one was a jacket. I took the wrong one. It was not that hard to figure that out.

Angela,2019-04-09T17:30:24Z,Here's the problem,"Here's the problem. For every good experience (which I assume is because they've never had to return) there are a thousand more bad. And I've tried to give this place so many chances but they fail at every turn with their customer service. Here's what I have had to do in order to get my money back for returns that are usually due to their mistake. 

1. Contact my bank to file fraud charges. I do this first because I already know I'm going to get a headache and no help. 

2. I email customer service - and cc their CEO - Nick Beighton - his email is his first name. last initial at asos in case you need to email him.

3.  I complain once a day until the either refund me promptly or my bank steps in to rectify the matter themselves. 

Customers should not have to chase down their refunds due to Asos mistake. Their customer service is abhorrent and needs a complete overall. Hell maybe their CEO should go as well because they obviously could care squat about their customers. Over it. I wanted to continue shopping here but the customer service alone has lost me.

On Monday July 15th I made an order of 5469,80 kr. on the app, this includes ""Premier Delivery"". Later that day I received an email that my order would be delayed, so in stead of being delivered on Tuesday 16th it would be delved on Wednesday 18th. I could live with that. Unfortunately, it still hasn’t been delivered, and today is the 21th of July! Which means it is belayed 6 days. I've been in contact with your costumer service by mail the past 6 days, but unfortunately it hasn't helped much. It seems that you still haven't sent my order, hence the costumer service mostly send me a standard reply of me receiving an email when the order has been sent. At the same time, you ask me to check with my neighbours and post office to see if the order has been delivered there which makes no sense since you later in the mail tell me that the parcel hasn't been packed yet. 
I haven't got a confirmation nor, nor a tracking number but the money has been withdrawn from my account on the 17th of July! 
 
I think this is outrageous and I would like to get in contact with somebody that doesn't just send me a standard reply. And I really, really think that a compensation is in it's right place for this very, very bad experience. I don't is is ok to treat your costumers this badly. If needed I can provide you a screen shot of all the mail correspondence.

I tried time and time again to speak to a human at customer services, but kept getting the same robotic email responses, with nobody clearly reading my query or bothering to answer the actual question I had.

Will not refund delivery charge or reissue orders that go missing. 
Separately we've received items that have clearly been used or left screwed up in a corner (had to return an expensive blazer because even ironing couldn't save it from the state it turned up).

Despite having a proof that I had returned an item and it was received by ASOS according to the tracking number, ASOS has not refunded my money. If ASOS' business model is to scam people by taking returns and not refunding money, then I should probably gather all the persons on TrustPilot who has not received their refunds and file for a class action lawsuit. Terrible company. I will never ever do business with ASOS again.",1,ASOS,4

Joanna,2018-12-10T09:48:40Z,"Terrible service, do not use ASOS","Terrible service. I ordered something for next day delivery. Over a week later this still hadn't been delivered. The tracking information said that a delivery had been attempted once in over 7 days but no slip was through the door and I had already told the courier to leave this in a safe place in my garden, which was ignored. I doubt delivery was even attempted at all. Further, the item needed no signature and was small enough to fit through my letterbox. I contacted ASOS 3 times to request that this be sorted as I needed the item urgently and the information on the courier website said to contact the retailer. Every time I got an automated response saying to wait until a few more days had passed and see if it would be delivered. This meant that despite ordering something over a week in advance and paying for next day delivery the item was not received in time. I still haven't had the item. Totally unacceptable and I will not be using ASOS again.",1,ASOS,4
Attila Yugo Kuruc,2018-12-08T11:28:32Z,"Extremely slow, bad services and terrible unfriendly costumer service support team","Dear Asos, I have recently spoken to one of your colleagues via phone who explained that your courier is unable to locate the postcode provided from my side hence they failed to deliver my parcel for the 3rd time in a row! Now first of all let me elaborate how extremely frustrating it is, that unless I call in to explain my situation I am most likely not to see this product like ever in my life, as of no one being able to explain the reason my parcel is still not with me! Now after being explained from your side the challenges you have - despite the fact that I have received another parcel yesterday assigned to the same exact address that I have provided to you - I have come up with an alternative solution which was to provide another address very close to the original one. Now your kind but less intelligent colleague has advised that this is not possible since the postcode has to match the existing address. Regardless of me trying to explain over and over again this to your kind yet again not so intelligent colleague that the address is assigned to the following postcode, he’s told me that he can not provide an alternative address to your courier, YET on their website they strictly point out that only the retailer can change the original destination of this. Now here I am again with no parcel - the suit I have ordered for my Christmas party which happened last night - with no money and with a lot of my precious time wasted. On top of that all you did was, not overcoming the challenge but given me the same solution which most likely is going to fail again based on the conversation with your colleague, as of your system not being able to allocate the postcode provided from your side! Here I am again waiting another day for you to come up with a better plan which we could’ve been solved immediately but your reaction time and responsiveness makes me want to cry! Yours Sincerely Attila",1,ASOS,4
Chloe ,2019-04-24T19:10:07Z,1 star is generous,"1 star is generous. Asos have the actual WORST customer service imaginable!!!!! I have no idea how they get away with it. TERRIBLE.

I contacted their 'customer service' team on facebook. The worst excuse of customer service I have EVER experienced. I initially spoke to someone regarding the issue on the 12th. 5 days went by and the issue still wasn't resolved which is not an acceptable time frame for such a simple issue. 
Aside from the excessive amount of time taken to deal with my issue, I have spoken to 13 different members of their customer service team on facebook and not one helped one bit. Half way through after sending multiple messages to asos explaining the issue I received this message back. 

'Hi Chloe, thanks for getting in touch about your premier delivery subscription - I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble purchasing premier. As your order purchasing premier was cancelled, it wont be active on your ASOS account and you'll need to repurchase. You can only use your Premier Delivery subscription on the same ASOS website that you bought it from. For example, if you bought Premier Delivery on the ASOS UK site, your subscription would only be valid for deliveries within the UK. In addition, you’re not able to use your Premier Delivery subscription for any orders placed on any of our other ASOS sites. You can find out which country your Premier Delivery subscription is for, by logging into ‘My Account’ and clicking on the ‘Premier Delivery’ tab. 

This reply was COMPLETELY unrelated to the issue I was contacting about and is clear this person had not bothered to read my issue or where it was up to what so ever. 

I asked twice to speak to someone via phone after getting nowhere in 3 days and as stated by their website, if requested I am entitled to a phone call. This was denied by two members of the team. One individual offered to have someone call me and the call never came. 

Eventually I found a contact number myself and spoke to their customer service team. Both members were more helpful but still barely helpful. They advised me that to take the issue further I would be best to contact the customer experience team. I went online to find the email which I could not find so asked an online agent. The response was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. I am appalled that they would employ people so incapable of customer service into a customer service roll.

I ordered a big order of clothes before my holiday so I could pick and choose what I wanted to keep and return. My parcel was LEFT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE and I came home to find it opened. About half of my items were missing. 
I contacted asos and they BLOCKED MY ACCOUNT. saying it's a rate occurrence that items have gone missing and that I have to foot the bill!!????? 
It's not my fault their courier either opened the parcel and took stuff or someone from the street went foriging as its left out for everyone to see. I didn't even get an email to say it was being delivered else I would have stayed in.

chrys,2019-01-11T13:48:05Z,Very disappointed with ASOS service,"Very disappointed with ASOS customer care. This Christmas Season i decided to purchase some friends gifts from ASOS and as it seems it was a very big mistake. One of the gifts was a Candlelight scented candle which arrived in a small carton box with a relevant label confirming that it was just that. So, i did not bother to open it and gift wrapped it and gave it to my friend yesterday when i got the chance to see her. To my surprise in the box there was no Candle, just a coffee mug with the letter ""C"" printed on it, even though the box still stated otherwise and the order was not that mug. In any case i told my friend to keep it since it was a gift and that i will be contacting the customer care to let them know of what happened. To my surprise and even though i had explained the situation to the customer representative and also supplied the necessary evidence pictures, i was requested to ask for the gift back!!! and to return it in order to get a refund. Note that the whole value of the item is just a few pounds, so who would actually go through the process of asking a gift back just to get a refund?!? I was expecting a much better approach from a store which claims to be market leader in Europe and also taking responsibility about their mistakes is not optional especially in cases where the fault is clearly an internal error!! There are online companies out there with much customer care and i'm sorry this is what ASOS has become!!",1,ASOS,4

Was supposedly shipped on the 9th May to be delivered in Canada on the 31st. I had it shipped at the local post office since there have been reports of parcel thefts in our new neighborhood's FB page; it's the safest delivery option since it's it's a government instance.  I contacted them during the first week of June to ask for explaination, since there is no middle man for the delivery to my door (it basically leaves their warehouse, transits, go through custom, and transits to the post office; I have to go pick it up myself). Their customer service said ""we have to wait until the end of June"". I explained about the wedding and said I had no guarantee that they would still be available had I to buy another one; asked a few questions which all were answered without much useful information.  At the end, I was told ""can you go ahead and close this chat window so the conversation can be ended"". Wow. What a nice way to end contact. It's now the 17th of June and customs never take that long. So I guess, I will have to dash more money to get another dress as 1- I doubt there are anymore available on their website by now 2- I wouldn't take the chance to purchase it from there anymore and it's a bugger as I can't seem to find Paperdolls dresses anywhere else 3- according to other reviews, I won't be getting a refund anytime soon (they probably won't send me the merchandise again if it is still available). ""To hell the wedding you have to attend end"", that's how much they care. I am about to contact them again, not expecting much but oh yeah I will put up a fight.

Jane,2020-01-02T14:07:00Z,Privacy concerns and terrible customer service.,"If I could give zero stars based on my recent experience I would.  Several months ago I moved, and therefore changed my delivery and billing address both.  I had one delivery go fine.  The next was sent to my old address - despite said address being deleted from my account (again, both billing and delivery were updated, ASOS customer service could not get this). I have no way to get to that address, or to contact them.  It's complicated, but I'm not getting into that.  Zero possibility.  And considering the address was completely off my account, I shouldn't be expected to do so.

I contacted their chat line - no help at all, but they did give me an email.  And oh boy.  I started emailing before Christmas 2019.  It's not January 2020.  I have gone back and forth with different people and had absolutely no help whatsoever.  I don't know how many more times I can reiterate that my address was updated, but they don't seem to get it.  

I'm concerned that if they've made such an error with my personal address (that again, was 100% gone from my account) what to say they're not going to have issues with payment?  But of course, those concerns were not addressed.  At all.  I send MANY emails and all of the ones I got back said something like ""

Aside the issue of a package being gone, there is now also the issue of my personal information.  ASOS has not helped at all, and has in fact made me more and more concerned with their conduct.  I do not expect any money back, but I would like something do be done regarding personal information, or at least to be assured this has been looked into. But nope.  Same generic email back everytime.  

There are much better online retailers one can use.  I've outgrown ASOS is many ways (mainly how unsustainable they are) but this is really the straw that broke the camels back.  Their customer service is terrible (same email over and over, my issues never being addressed) I'm concerned about the security of my personal information, and annoyed with the situation in general. 

If you have an account with ASOS that has any personal information I urge you to delete it. They clearly don't care a whit about privacy for their customers based on how they've ""dealt"" with my legitimate concerns.",1,ASOS,5

Customer Sarah ,2019-12-04T13:00:51Z,Seriously don't shop here !!!!!!,"I am extremely disappointed with the service from this company and would highly recommend anyone using this site to think twice about shopping with them !
I live in the uk, I have placed 4 orders in total and only 1 of those arrived as paid for as for the other 3 first was placed as a single order though I only recieved 1 of the 4 garments ordered as a single order. When I contacted the company through their online chat I waited almost half hour before connecting with anyone and was informed they had no idea why this happened but they did request those items to be re ordering and sent so at least they did sort this out quickly!
Then I placed another order 2 weeks later, buying 3 items though ordered 2 separately but both within 10 mins of each other paying for next day, this was on a Friday.
On the Saturday  ( next day ) I only recieved the first order and the second one with the 2 items didn't arrive, made contact again waiting a long time before getting through and was told I'd have to wait till Monday, in Monday still nothing waited again to get through on their online chat and was informed I had to wait till Tuesday, Tues came and still nothing, again waited to connect and was informed it could now be passed to their specialist team to investigate. 
I received one email to inform me the specialist tem now had my query and would get back to me shortly but if I had anymore questions or concerns this person would be happy to help, that was Tuesday morning, now Wednesday and I've still heard Nothing, I sent an email to the person saying he would be happy to help and he hasn't responded, I've gone back to the site to use the online chat only to find this is no longer an option  !
My order comes to the value of £154 and yet they have done absolutely Nothing to resolve it. I can't speak to anyone and they continue to advertise these items for sale so I don't understand why I am having such issues !
I would seriously suggest that anyone thinking of buying from Asos look elsewhere  !",1,ASOS,5
Craig,2019-12-07T10:24:05Z,Worst company I have ever dealt with - Read up on your comsumer rights before using them,"Worst company I have ever dealt with. Used to order from them a lot a few years ago but stopped after getting fed up with delivery problems and being sent an expensive wool jumper which had clearly been shrunk in the wash. Customer service were a nightmare to deal with and they never refunded return postage for faulty products. The company was more hassle than they were worth.

A few years later and I decided to order a christmas present for a family member from them on black friday. Big mistake. They took payment and dispatched the order. However, the order has been marked as delivered despite no attempted delivery to the address specified on the order, no correspondance from the courier (fastway) and no indication as to where the parcel was left. This has happened purely because they have chosen to use the worst courier company available. 

Anyway, I emailed them 3 days ago expalining the situation and asking for the order to be delivered to the correct address or for a refund. They haven't even bothered to reply and there's not even a phone number for customer service. I'm now left without my order despite having being charged and these guys don't even have the courtesy to reply to my emails. Save yourself the hassle everyone. I won't be ordering from ASOS again.

At this point, I'll now either have to decide whether to get paypal to action a chargeback or take them to small claims court for the money they have taken from me. 

Honestly, I don't know how so many people use this company. Their prices aren't cheap ( generally you can find same products cheaper elsewhere unless on sale). Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. They use the delivery company (fastway couriers) with the worst reputation and they ignore consumer law.",1,ASOS,5

Hermes send me an email saying my parcel will be wirh me between 5 and 7pm. And nothing no knock on the door no parcel no nothing. I track the parcel and it says there has been a delay. So the next day I get another email from hermes I make sure I'm in. Again it was between 5 and 7pm and nothing no knock no one turns up no parcel. I then contact asos customer service. Who tell me to wait until the 14 of October. I said but I've paid for next day delivery I shouldn't have to wait for 7 days. And I needed the clothes for the 8th of October. They just said you've got to wait until the 14th.so yesterday the 10th I get another email from hermes my parcel will be delivered again. Between 5 and 7pm. I wait in once again 7 o'clock comes and nothing. So I track the parcel to read it saying they have attempted to deliver the parcel 3 times and there sending it back to the sender. They haven't knocked once not once. They haven't even pulled up out the front of my house let alone knocked. I then contact asos once again. Saying how bad this is and I'm disgusted. They email back saying they have checked and it is going back to the warehouse. And they will refund me within 10 days and that's it. No sorry no nothing I will not be ordering through asos again. Hermes are useless and asos customer service are useless. I never write reviews but this is just a terrible service,1,ASOS,5
Amy ,2019-08-30T19:16:15Z,Despicable treatment of loyal customers,"I am absolutely fuming after my most recent experience with ASOS customer service. After being a frequent customer for a number of years, I had countless issues with my most recent orders. I contacted their customer service on Twitter, on Facebook, on email and on their website via live chat and each time was dismissed, patronised and belittled. None of their advisers seem to have any desire to actually help or resolve any issues. Their first approach to a complaint is to blame the customer which I feel is an absolutely disgraceful way to treat a customer. Once they have your money they do not care. 

After contacting customer service on literally every avenue they offer and being ignored, I returned orders after the 28 day time period. As a disabled person it is not easy for me to get to a store to return the collect + parcels so I therefore waited to be advised by customer services so I didn't have to make multiple journeys to the shop. When it became apparent they were just going to completely ignore me, I sent the parcels back and I am now being refused a refund. 

I have again had to contact them multiple times/ways and have now had 2 of their advisers tell me this situation is my fault, not theirs and that they refuse to help and they have ended the chat, not allowing me to even respond. 

Absolutely vile treatment of their customers. 

I have noticed the quality of ASOS own range/products drastically decline in the last few years and in combination with the appalling customer service, I believe this will be the downfall of the company.",1,ASOS,5

Last year I ordered about 4 dresses and I returned them because they were either poor quality or didn’t fit.

Maria van Rheenen,2018-12-11T15:58:59Z,Abismal customer service and no responsibility for delivery problems,"My order was due to arrive yesterday. I was busy changing my baby when the doorbell rang and hoped they would leave a card or put it in my safe place. Not so. No card was left, but Hermes sent an email saying delivery was successfully delivered to me (my name) with a signature included (not mine). I’ve checked safe spots and nothing. Tried contacting ASOS but their chat wasn’t working well and I was left waiting then disconnected. Their email form also wouldn’t send. I finally reached someone on chat after 3 long attempts to be told I would hear from them in 5 days but if not to contact again. What? I was counting on my order for an event this week and feel jilted. Nothing was done to reassure or correct the situation, which includes fraudulent practices (forging my signature). Furthermore I have not been given any contact information to complain to Hermes, their courier, directly. Abismal service!",1,ASOS,5
Lāsma Petrāne,2019-07-12T14:54:24Z,Do NOT order from ASOS - no longer reliable,"This review is a warning to all ASOS customers.
I have ordered from ASOS for many years, but lately it has turned upside down into the worst experience ever.
1) ASOS did not deliver my order.
2) ASOS did not warn me about any delivery delays.
3) ASOS lied and provided me false tracking number claiming that they have dispatched the order (the tracking No. provided no results).
4) ASOS informed me about a one-day-delay in the delivery.
5) ASOS finally informed me that my order is cancelled and that I will receive a refund in 5-10 days (after checking my account I see that the order has NOT been cancelled).
I placed my order on 28th of June. I haven't had the chance to actually speak to a human being. All Customer Care replies are ready-made automatic responses.
If your order is delayed, immediately open a case in PayPal to receive your refund.
ASOS is FRAUD.",1,ASOS,5
Sarah N,2019-02-26T04:47:21Z,"Bad quality, poor customer service, good returns","The quality of their stock is terrible and they use terrible couriers. Their customer service is no help. You should expect that the clothes will be poor quality/badly fitting so don't get your hopes up. 

They are worth the risk if you want to order something with the off-chance that it will fit, as their returns are very smooth and easy.

If you do order, I recommend ordering a few sizes if you want their own brand clothes. You never know how big/small/see-through/buttons-missing something will be until it arrives.

I use next day deliver for a year for a one-off payment. This can be helpful for last minute events/gifts. But they will still sell those of you who don't have this next day delivery on busy days, and then customer service blames you for ordering on a busy day when it doesn't arrive (no exaggeration, this happened to me over the phone).

All in all, after a few years of using them (and 2 1-year ASOS Premier subscriptions used), I will no longer be using them. I will be using quality retailers like Riess as they are actually better value and cheaper in the long-run.",1,ASOS,5
khadijah,2019-06-25T21:09:34Z,Asos is getting complacent?,"Used to purchase from them for many years without problems. Had no issues with returning items, cancelling orders or refunds. However, I had to return an item I made in my recent purchase as the fit was small.

Currently returns from Singapore has changed to Aramex instead of Singapore Post. So I chose Aramex Home Collection, just schedule a pickup and pass it along to the deliveryman. Simple? No.

Deliveryman did not turn up at all while I was home the whole day. Contacted Asos on the next working day and the customer service officer told me they had no contact with ARAMEX. and I had to contact them myself. Why then did they ask to contact ASOS when you need help? They are not helpful at all. Rescheduled another pick up today but NO SIGN OF DELIVERY MAN AT ALL. Such nonsense. 

Quote from email: ""Amending your collection:
If you need to change your collection date, or if you have missed the driver then please contact ASOS"", ""If you need any assistance please contact ASOS""

Aramex has really bad ratings and is unreliable. Makes it really difficult to return items now. Definitely won't be shopping here as there are better websites that have faster delivery time and easier return methods.

Update: Delivery man from Aramex did not turn up for rescheduled pick up",1,ASOS,5

I tried to get them to explain why over several emails: I received a mixture of bot responses, canned responses that were not relevant, and responses that refused to acknowledge the problem or explain it.

Customer,2019-07-10T20:09:27Z,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Seems I'm not the only one furious with ASOS customer service. I love them as a place to buy from and have always paid £9 a year for next day delivery. 
BUT this time they have let me down and their customer service was disgusting. I purchased an item and received something completely wrong. When sending photo proof and asking for the correct item to be sent they told me they can no longer do this, but I'm more than welcome to return for a refund and re order in the mean time. This has put me out of pocket as refunds take up to 14 working days and I do not have the item I ordered. I've also had the inconvenience of having to go to the post office to return the item when I shouldn't have had to do this if the correct thing had been delivered. 
Customer service was completely useless, told me they couldn't help, but instead encouraged me to use their credit company Klarna to order as I wouldn't have to pay back for up to 45 days. Not only was this unhelpful but also incredible worrying that this is something they're pushing for people to do! 
Overall I feel completely let down, and am in two minds about ordering again as I feel it isn't something I should have to do",1,ASOS,5
miss maria leventis,2018-11-08T23:28:38Z,Disgusted with Asos and its shoddy…,"Disgusted with Asos and its shoddy couriers who failed to even attempt delivery, yet claim they have, on a next evening parcel delivery containing over £700 worth of goods. Apparently they couldn't find the address, yet also didn't call once to even ask directions if they were lost, and having waited in 3 evenings in a row because I repeatedly got texts saying they were coming that evening. Even more appalled that ASOS say they cannot do anything about this, cannot get them to send it to a nearby click and collect store nor to use the written instructions I provided. So instead, I am meant to re-order everything, hope it is all in stock, and pay for a further order, when ASOS won't even refund me for almost 3 weeks! Its a shoddy service. Can't trust them or their couriers. I have tried to go through their customer service team but just get told the same thing repeatedly. Nothing they can do?! I will be telling everyone I know not to bother taking the risk on ASOS for Christmas, birthday presents or any orders they might actually need because they'll simply be out of pocket and nothing will arrive, or if it does, not even on time. Reading all other recent emails, it sounds like you're doing this to a lot of customers lately. I wonder whether ASOS are about to go into administration hence the refusal to repay out of pocket customers. Don't use them",1,ASOS,5

Nevertheless, uncontent with their long waiting time for issuing such a simple document, when I asked them for an invoice 45 days after my purchase, they replied saying that they need 30 working days to issue one!!!!! That is INSANE! An invoice should be issued upon payment. You don't go to the supermarket to buy groceries and receive an invoice 75 days later. What's so difficult about making one?

So in the end, I not only did not get the items I wanted, I also had to pay for them.

Suraya,2019-12-22T03:08:20Z,Ridiculous How Bad Their Customer Service and Follow up Has Become,"I've been a loyal ASOS customer for nearly a decade now and have even continued to purchase from them when I'm back in my home country through international shipping (where I used to receive parcels within a week). But this is the LAST TIME I'll ever buy from them - their customer service has deteriorated so badly beyond belief - you'd think the more big shot of a company you become, you'd invest more in actually treating your customers right; but clearly this isn't of interest to them.

It all started with purchasing my usual staples from ASOS on Cyber Monday which was given a delivery date of 3 weeks after (which has since elapsed). Nearing to the delivery date, I sent a few emails to follow up on it as the status of my parcel was ambiguous on their delivery tracker and received their usual automated emails instead. I had already suspected that a couple of the items (tanning oil) were wrongly marked as prohibited by customs as I experienced the same issue before and it was processed and delivered thereafter. I remembered that customer service took more of an initiative then.

1 week later, Mitchell finally replied to my email by not even addressing me by my name or apologising for their late reply (um, customer service 101), giving me the most nonchalant response of 'here are the FAQs for custom charges for your country' and not even providing any explanation of what is actually up with my parcel or where even is it. I had already explained in earlier emails that I've experienced the same issue before (I'm sure you have a customer communication tracker, use it) and it's likely the same scenario, as none of the contents of the parcel are actually prohibited nor have I ordered anything to warrant custom charges cost-wise. Moreover, if an item is frequently marked as prohibited, then do all of us a favour and update that on its product page before entering this debacle. 

Also, in their FAQ sheet, they said you'll be notified of any custom charges, which I hadn't received any so felt like my issue was being scapegoated by this illusive custom charges when actually they haven't even bothered to look into it properly and troubleshoot it. Ok, let's play along with this scenario that I do have to pay, do you think a FAQ sheet covers it? Mate, where's the link to pay, I'm over here in a foreign country and it's on the onus of you, as the sender, to follow up on it before it reaches me, as a recipient, when my parcel is just sitting duck somewhere. Can't be bothered to look into it - ok, no problem just get it returned to you and refund me, provide that as an alternative option. Most importantly, keep your customers updated on their parcel's status and take more responsibility for your service and parcels you send out, rather than keeping them in the dark.

ASOS, sort yourself out, mate.",1,ASOS,6

I emailed ASOS on Monday for them to review this. I emailed their Care inbox, but received a bounce back saying their inbox was full. I then emailed Nick B, their CEO. So far, I have had no response. I then messaged them on Facebook on Tuesday and still, no response.

My initial message told you that I noticed in my confirmation email of my order that the standard delivery times had drastically increased from the usual 3 days to over a week. My issue is that I need my items this week for an event and that I feel misled as the website was wholly unclear prior to confirming the order that the new standard delivery was a date pulled at random in the distant future. After reading over his reply, I began typing my response and he sent an additional message to say that as I have not replied he is going to end the conversation, which is ridiculous as I know he can see me typing and it had only been two minutes!! So I started to type faster hoping to send it but he ended the chat immediately!! I am absolutely livid at the lack of respect, I would have just accepted a simple apology initially once I received the information I needed but now I am furious over the awful customer service experience.

Terence Ruffle,2019-02-05T12:15:25Z,"...PLEASE PEOPLE: DON'T BUY FROM ASOS, THEY ARE SCAMMERS,","I've just figured out the Asos scam.

If you read a lot of the negative ( and a few of the positive ) reviews, it's a common occurrence that us buyers will either be sent the wrong size, or the wrong order.

Meanwhile, the department they laughingly call ""customer service"", advise that stocks are low of the item you require, and that if you still want the item, you really ought to order now, whilst stocks last.

So you return the order, and order another size or item. At this point the buyer has no goods, but Asos has 2 payments, so who's on top at this point?

If foolishly, like me, you order a third time ( and of course, you're GUARANTEED not to get the correct order again ) and they send the wrong item again ( incredibly my third order arrived in the box associated with the product, but with a completely different product inside! ) now Asos have 3 of your payments and you have no goods.

Imagine if they can scam a mere 10 people like that per week: they're holding onto funds that aren't theirs, which they can do whatever they want with. It could certainly be making them money whilst it's still in their account. I know a lot of companies do this but not for 20 DAYS!!

And why the hell should it take ( they say ) 10 days for them to receive a return? Once Collect+ have scanned the parcel, it's in their system, and they know they'll get their goods back. 

And again, another 10 days after the return to receive a refund? Why? If it's not them utilising the funds they've robbed from us then I don't know what it. If Amazon can process a refund within three days of acknowledging the return, why can't Asos? 

PLEASE PEOPLE: DON'T BUY FROM ASOS, THEY ARE SCAMMERS, YOU WON'T GET YOU GOODS AND THEY'LL KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

One last thing: how come Asos never bother to reply to ANY of the reviews? They simply don't give a damn, that's why......",1,ASOS,6
Soraia Da Cunha Jeronimo,2019-03-09T12:32:30Z,Thieves!,"I contacted Asos 16 working days ago, and enquired about a parcel they stated was delivered, it has been 16 working days and they have no resolved my issue. Instead, they have asked me to wait 24-48 hours after sending over 70 emails, twitter DM's, Facebook DM's and Instagram DM's. 24-48 hours equals 16 working days every time I ask them to sort this out they tell me to wait 24-48 hours. I have asked them to sort this out, to send me the order I paid £180 for!
They still have my £180 and have not sent me my items! I have requested a refund and they are refusing to do so! 

Stay away from ASOS they are thieves and their customer service if you can even call it that is disgusting, They ignored you for days and when they do respond to you they quote the incorrect order number/name/address breach of GDPR? I've been called so many different names, it's embarrassing. They do not care about any of their customers!",1,ASOS,6

DJP,2019-05-10T17:53:09Z,What a shocking company,"What a shocking company. You pay for next day delivery. Hermes loses the parcel. You call and they expect you to resolve the issue with Hermes yourself rather than ASOS doing it given you have paid an annual fee (Hermes want asos to resolve with them). Hermes admit losing the parcel and you call ASOS three times to explain this which has cost £14.25. All they say is you have to wait 24 hours. 24 hours fo what? We’d already waited a week. Awful

Customer service by telephone. Expect a short call to cost you about £5. Then expect the following,

They don’t listen to what you are saying
They don’t try to understand what you are saying
They don’t address the point you are making
They contradict themselves 
They make no attempt to resolve the problem.

They charge premium rates if you call them.
Live chat simply close the chat and cut you off. All the above applies and offers the same routine and nonsense.

Eventually I got a refund through contacting with facebook messenger but they can’t refund the outrageous call costs.therefore i’m over £14 lighter by calling the so called customer care team. All the person did on messenger was to confirm what we’d been explaining to tell them all along.

Now they say that they won’t reimburse my calls because. Are you ready?  Because they aren’t equipped to take large volumes of calls and for that reason do not advertise the ‘customer service’ telephone number. Couldn’t make this up!",1,ASOS,6

Tamasin,2019-06-11T06:59:30Z,"Brainless ""customer service"" advisors let the company down","Loyal ASOS customer for years, not had may problems really until it comes down to needing to talk to someone. 

Once their delivery driver allegedly attempted delivery 3 times however left no card or a blank card so I was unable to rearrange delivery for a suitable time. After getting nowhere with online chat, the order got returned to the warehouse even though I needed it, and I had to reorder. Waste of both of our time! 

Now, I have 2 orders, standard delivery. When I checked why they haven't arrived, website is telling me it will take 10 days because they are busy! Not acceptable. It did not say this when I ordered. I even purchased the premier delivery with the second order and got free delivery (which has to be over £25 to qualify) however the order only amounted to £21.95. So I'm struggling to understand why it has been processed with standard delivery for free, rather than the premier that I purchased!! 

Tried online chat again (for some reason!) and was met with a completely snooty and blunt advisor who did nothing for me, other than tell me the order will arrive in 10 days and I don't have the option to cancel. Then asked what else they can do to help?! I said you haven't helped me at all so far.. then they ended the chat!! Laughable! AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOWHERE TO COMPLAIN PROPERLY.

They are definitely going down hill. 

On the plus side, if you need a job that requires zero skills whatsoever (or a brain!) and pays you to do absolutely nothing of value - ASOS online customer service could be right up your street!",1,ASOS,6

I just found out that the standard delivery is now  £20. And i have to buy items up £200 to get free delivery to ship to Mauritius. I find this really ridiculous. 
Is that a new way to make money?  They could have put a significant sum like £30 - to £50  to obtain free shipping.

Paul M,2018-12-22T14:46:43Z,"Internal theft, ok! Lies off Call Centre and appalling post sale...","So daughter wanted expensive watch, happy to buy, but would rather have given cash so she could buy in sales.  Daughter said no, so foolishly ordered off ASOS.
Have annual subscription so came next day.
Waited till she was open to open.  Wasn't happy at state of outer box (not main delivery box, but a small white one inside), but as solid MK box inside this, was happy enough.  Opened box to see what this £150 watch looked like and...
nothing.  There was an instruction manual and the felt thing the watch sits on but some thief at the ASOS warehouse had successfully stolen the watch.
Ok these things happen.  Really not happy but they happen.  Phoned 0207 756 1000 (for anyone else who wants to speak to someone) and was told they couldn't issue a replacement or refund until they had received the item (an empty box) back!  Demanded a manager callback, assured within 24 hours.  As surely proof I had sent the item back (CollectPlus) would be enough for them to issue a replacement.
Multiple DMs on Twitter, where they asked what had happened and for proof I had sent back, etc, all supplied (including photo of empty box, packaging, ect)...
Next day, another script monkey ignores what had gone on the night before and spewed the 7 day investigation, further 5 days for refund... and to be fair, lost it at this point!  It was when they said missing item and then as I had received the incorrect item!
Was told if I swear again they won't help!  It doesn't actually matter that they weren't helping, just clutching at straws to pretend it was my fault!
So in mid afternoon, called back again...
Today's lie was timescale has gone from 24 hrs to 48 hrs!  Requested he go and check.  Tried to refuse.  Demanded he check that I was getting the callback that was agreed, came back and said no!  
So item stolen by staff, lied to by CS and managers who apparently don't care one way or the other.  Sadly only thing making me feel slightly better, is reading everyone else's horror stories as at least it's not just me!",1,ASOS,6

Julie Hall,2019-03-22T14:31:55Z,Another case of s**t customer service.,"In february i ordered a pair of leopard print boots along with 6 other items, when the order arrived i opened the boots box to find a pair of cheap and chatty looking snakeprint boots so i returned them (just human error i thought), however i have just made 2 orders for my son as he goes on holiday in 2 weeks time and one of the items was a pair of calvin klein sliders, again opened the box to find a cheaper pair of calvin klein flip flops so i immediately ordered a return and went to live chat (funny how they are always the cheaper version) . I was told to send them back and i would be refunded or could have an exchange once they recieved them back and investigated, i emailed to say my son was going away in 2 weeks needed these in a hurry and since this is second time its happened in a couple of months i wanted to put in a complaint, i got passed from pillar to post and was told to either wait for return to be handled, buy them again and ask for express delivery or use klarna, why the bloody hell should i have to do any of that when its asos whos at fault, they should have sent out the replacement as they were at fault, god sake man if you cant even pack a pair of bloody shoes right then theres something wrong, i dont know whats going on with these stores but they seriously need to work on their staff training and customer service, another retailer i will not be purchasing from again and iv been ordering at the very least £100 a month of products.
UPDATE
So we returned the incorrect pair of shoes with it clearly marked on returns note that we wanted an exchange for the correct pair, as mentioned and also told to asos my son goes on holiday soon, well what would you know they have gone and refunded the shoes and not sent an exchange even though the correct sliders have been in stock all along, didnt think they could actually get any worse, got onto chat to be told id have to order them again and they would maybe refund delivery charge, well no thankyou ASOS il spend my money on a retailer who can actually do their job. I will be very surprised if you are still in business this time next year, we lose the voucher scheme then the service just goes to s**t, i know i will not be entertaining asos ever again.

K,2019-03-21T21:04:22Z,I’m absolutely annoyed to be writing…,"I’m absolutely annoyed to be writing this review because I used to LOVE asos I’ve shopped with them for so so so long I’ve ALWAYS bought premier delivery since I can remember!! I had to return one order because I ordered two different sizes and returned an item (this got refunded 3 days later EXACT) I was also returning another order which didn’t fit my partner on the same date, I didn’t receive a refund or an email to say they’d recieved it so I left it around another week, still nothing. So I tried emailing in today from their website (I tried this three times) but their website wouldn’t submit the online form.. so I decided to use the live chat to find out what’s happening, I explained this to “RHYS” who said she/he couldn’t give me any info because my live chat email was an old email and my asos email was my current email, i explained this to her/him and that it wouldn’t let me sign out so it wouldn’t show an email so he could then let me get some info (doesn’t really make sense because I could still be anyone) and it wouldn’t let me change the chat email to my current and asked if he could then just email my current email which is linked to my asos account and I could then reply back so they know it’s me, she/he totally ignored that and just went crazy copy and pasting their scripts they use and saying he couldn’t email an email that isn’t on my account (so they basically ignored what I had said to them after I’d explained the email on my account is the one I want him to message and NOT the live chat one) anyway he also said that they could only give me info if I could sign out of live chat (which it doesn’t let me) which means that should go against their “rules” too I could be anyone or contact them on social media which anyone can make up a social media account or some don’t even hav social media! I explained that it’s private and I didn’t want to use it just to contact them and say the same stuff as I am now.. I also explained that I’ve had trouble before and that the person before literally just emailed my current email that’s linked to my account so I could reply there and prove ITS ME! I even sent over the proof of postage and still wasn’t willing to help me. They started saying they couldn’t send an email unless it was the one on the system and that they can’t help me further and closed the chat... so they basically just went against what I’d asked them to do and admitted in the end she/he could just email the email id asked her/him to email!!! So to get my money back I had to contact them on social media.. Now i thought my expectations from their customer service team couldn’t get any worse, oh I was so WRONG! Anyway! I contacted them explained EVERYTHING again, and sent over the screenshots to show the website wouldn’t let me send an email from there, sent the screenshots from useless RYHS to show id asked them to send an email to the email on the system and refused. And explained that I’m getting annoyed and shouldn’t have to use my social media, I mean there’s still a few people out their with the same name as me I still could be anyone so I’ve no idea what difference it made contacting them on social media than when I was on live chat! Just basically wasting my time.. so first I spoke to Paul! He literally read my message and I know he looked at the images because he located my order number from them, and asked me to give him my email that’s linked to the account in order to talk about my order for security reasons (whch i gave this to RHYS) and then said if I didn’t know this and needed changing to go change it in my settings I could. So I gave him it! I explained again that I didn’t need to change anything on my asos account and advised that the fault lies in live chat and explained the difference between both emails and which is on live chat and which is linked to my asos! So a little while later I got a message from Adam now and said he needed my my order number (which I explained earlier his colleague even quoted my order number as well as being in the screenshots I sent over) so this Adam didn’t read the previous chat OR look at the images. So to adam I explained this AGAIN and asked if one person could please deal with this so I can stop explaining I advised that everything is in the chat! Then last but least another person replied just to say they’ve now sent the information over to their specialist team and I have to wait for another 48 hours for a reply. So I literally went through all that today which RYHS could have just sent the information over to their specalist team at the start and they would then email the correct email! Just a joke and I’m done with asos, I’ll just miss some of their clothes. :)

EDIT - Now I understand why asos have such bad reviews on trustpilot, their customer service team either need sacking or putting back into training, this is coming from someone who’s worked in marketing and customer service!

E Laura,2019-02-19T18:27:30Z,Worst Online Purchasing Experience I Have Ever Encountered,"Ordered 3 dresses yesterday and selected next day delivery for today.

Got an email at 4am today saying one of the dresses is out of stock and I'll be refunded which I didn't actually see given the send time - first disappointment. They say they hold your items but sell them elsewhere.

Anyway, my partner waited in between the hour delivery slot they gave us - no items came and I got a text to say they attempted delivery but no one answered. Ended up having to call DPD who said they hadn't actually received the order from ASOS so no idea why I was given tracking info - waste of my partners time. I was told to contact ASOS directly. While on live chat with ASOS, I received another email from DPD saying they did have it, but the driver went to the wrong address. Good job the incorrect address tenants weren't in or theyd have had my dresses for free - though they do now have the calling card and potentially my personal information. 

ASOS customer services were largely unhelpful, offered no real apology, and their best solution was to have it redelivered on a day not to my convenience. They offered delivery between now (Tues) and next Thursday. I asked for Sunday as it is the only day I'll be home. Then told it wasn't possible to guarantee Sunday delivery. I asked them to deliver to my partners work - not possible for them. Now I have to go and pick it up myself from a local depot.

Having paid they are saying it will take up to three weeks to process my refund for an item they cannot supply!! When I tried to pursue this with customer services they hung up on me twice each time saying it was my responsibility to correct their error before they would refund me and there was nothing more they could do other than suspend my account if I didn't return the item.

Susan Hogg,2019-10-12T00:24:38Z,Payment taken and goods not received,"Payment taken and goods not received

Very negative experience after years of being a loyal customer.

After moving house I mistakenly ordered a parcel to my previous address. I informed asos as soon as I noticed this, they had a notice on their website that there was a delay in delivery times due to a busy period and to add a day to your expected delivery date for all parcels. I had ordered standard delivery and my parcel hadn't been shipped yet, I thought this would allow for plenty of room to manoeuvre this situation. I got in touch with asos straight away and they refused to cancel the order. They knowingly posted the parcel to an address that they know I don't reside at. I have contacted them again as the parcel has now been marked as delivered on their website and they have informed me that this is now a civil dispute between me and the person living at the address. Asos have taken full payment for my order which I have no received.

Asos's main point was that their aim was to deliver to the provided address which they have done. To me this is completely negligent of my attempt to make clear to them that the provided address is not accessible by me and I will not personally be able to return the parcel to asos if it is sent to this address.

I am really dissatisfied with the customer service experience I have received. Asos have lost a long time customer.",1,ASOS,7

becki,2019-09-05T07:54:03Z,Returns/Refunds are a shambles,"Over the past couple of years I had numerous friends tell me of their diabolical customer service with ASOS. As I hadn’t experienced it I assumed that they were exaggerating.

I had bought a massive order with Klarna, all of the order was returned as it was unsuitable and I thought nothing of it until Klarna began chasing me for the payment.
I was away at the time so spent the full weekend worrying about having to pay for a £100+ order I hadn’t kept as I wasn’t sure I still had the receipt at home.

I emailed ASOS chasing up the return to receive a response telling me they’d tried to refund me in July but it failed due to a technical glitch. Nobody bothered checking the refunds had gone through nor was any goodwill given for the stressful situation. Legally ASOS were required to refund the order within 14 days of receiving the refund back - when I stated this I was simply told again that it was a technical glitch. Maybe they need something in place to flag such issues.

After this I sat with bated breath as I had returned some further orders. One of them I posted back before the 28 day deadline. However I have just received an email stating they were refunding my money onto gift card. As a company they need to take into consideration the delivery times back to themselves and also their own return processing time - which lately seems a hell of a lot longer than usual.

I am currently awaiting a response to my email about this however I’m not hopeful.",1,ASOS,7

Ellen Rowland,2018-12-20T09:34:29Z,Unwilling to help despite several order issues,"I have spoken with two customer reps regarding an order in the past two days but they have been unable to resolve my issues.

I originally ordered an item during the sale where it was £72.00 not £90.

I ordered a size 14, but a size 16 arrived so I exchanged it for a 14. This was still far too big, so I sent back the 14 and ordered a 12. 

I am keeping the 12 as it was the only one that fit of the coats, and I did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back again so close to Christmas, despite the fact that it arrived missing a button and someone had sewn the collar to the coat so it was not in appropriate condition for sale at full price. I forgot to add my student discount to this order and was told that:

- I could not have my discount added retrospectively

- I could not receive a refund of the sale price difference (£18.00) despite originally ordering the item when it was on sale, because instead of ticking ""exchange"" on the form for the return of the size 14 coat, I simply sent it back as a return and ordered a 12 separately.

I think that it would be reasonable on this occasion to refund the difference as I requested, since I effectively did exchange the coat, not refund it, and honour my student discount since there have been several issues with this purchase.

I would like to be able to say that I received great service from Asos as this has always been the case in the past, but on this occasion I feel let down.

Since the customer service reps on the online chat have been unable to help, I have sent a formal complaint.

I would appreciate it if I could receive my discounts to resolve the issue once and for all.",1,ASOS,7

Obviously GCSE Maths is not a requirement for the people processing returns, and instead of refunding the cost of one dress minus 15%, they also deducted the 15% discount of the dress that I wanted to keep, meaning that my refund was less than it should be.
I informed them immediately, even telling them the exact amount I should have been refunded, because I was certain they could not work it out on their own. 
I was told that they had issued the refund shortfall and it would be back in my account in 10 working days. 11 working days later, and no refund. After enquiring several times and being reassured that it was being refunded back to my paypal, they have now admitted that they LIED, and no refund was issued to paypal because they apparently can't process the refund that way!
Now I'm being told that if I want my money back (erm, of course) I have to add my card details on their site and wait god knows how long for the refund.

It got to 14:40 and the parcel hadn't arrived so I contacted Asos and asked them to chase the parcel, the lady was very short on the phone talking with an attitude as if she was fed up. She put me on hold to see what had happened and then came back saying that they already attempted delivery I tried to explain this to her that this always happens on a Sunday with Hermes they send message saying delays and you wait for it to come and then suddenly they just send another message saying the tried to deliver bit no one at home, blatant lie once again. Tried to explain this to Customer Service but she wasn't interested just kept saying that's what they have said in a snap way, I left the call feeling as if she was accusing me of lying about being in waiting. So disappointed with Asos. Maybe they don't care as I have the 1 year next day delivery plan so they know they don't have to repay the delivery charge everytime Hermes don't deliver.

Caroline,2019-07-02T19:42:58Z,"""Next working day delivery""? more like Next NIGHT delivery....","Even though I paid for ""Next working day delivery"" the order still has not showed up on the given delivery day, and all I was told by the Asos online service staff was to wait untill the end of the day, which would be 12pm and it is now 9.30pm. The shop where I am to pick up the parcel closes at 10pm, which means I won't be able to pick the parcel up if it even is delivered within the next 2,5 hours. It's such a shame that I was to pay extra money for a faster delivery, when it didn't live up to it's standards. At least Asos should inform everyone that it depends on their pick-up-shop's closing time, because unfortunately they only deliver at midnight. I am lucky that I still have a few hours before my flight tomorrow, but I will never buy from Asos again, at least not until they fix their delivery methods. And if I am not getting a notifications or email saying that the order has been delivered before 12pm, I will demand my money back, at least the money I spend on the delivery.",1,ASOS,8

Warning !! Check any refunds from ASOS !!I am a loyal customer of Asos and order regularly. I ordered almost £400 worth of stuff last month as they were running a special 25% for students. It is the company’s policy not to give discount on items already for sale which is fair enough . I returned an item and found that Asos had taken 25% off my refund ! It was never 25% off as it was already on sale !
I have been trying to get help on live chat , twitter and email  with no joy 
This could be happening to other customers so make sure you check what they refund you 
Is correct 
I hope that it was honest mistake!

I ordered over $600 worth of merchandise and it never showed up! I contacted ASOS via email, was very nice, and just asked where my package was. They told me they'd contact me in 24 hours. I got an email 72 hours later saying that I HAVE BEEN BLOCKED from all contact with Asos and they will not be responding to me, that my entire account is blocked and they wont be helping me at all and I can contact my bank.

I had outstanding refunds i was waiting for and they just deleted my account!!!!! My package didn't show up and I get no explanation as to why?!?!?!!?!?!

Stephanie,2019-03-21T13:36:06Z,Received damaged shoes not once but TWICE!!!,"Ordered a pair of expensive Ralph Lauren shoes for my partner's 30th birthday. Firstly, they arrived in a damaged Ralph Lauren box and then when I checked the shoes themselves I found they were also scuffed and scratched. I got in contact first with the ASOS online team who said it must have happened in transit (highly doubtful) and secondly no apology but just to send them back for a refund. The person I dealt with was also very sarcastic & said I should wait for one of their summer promotions if I wanted a discount on the damaged shoes - I'm sorry, but why would they even sell them in that state to begin with?? I then decided to call them directly (I was told on the chat I was unlikely to be answered but luckily someone did). The girl I spoke to apologized and said it was obviously a warehouse mistake and wouldn't happen again... WELL, it was my mistake to believe this. Due to birthday time pressure, I ordered the shoes again despite having not yet been refunded for the first damaged pair yet... The ""new"" pair that arrived a few days later were even worse than the first!! There was no Ralph Lauren box this time, just a brown one with the shoes chucked in with some torn tissue paper. The shoes were in appalling scuffed condition and I noticed on one of the shoes it had a ripped off tag meaning they had blatantly been used before or already sent back to them. I called up immediately, again nothing they could do for this huge inconvenience except for me to send the shoes back again, meaning I have paid TWICE for damaged shoes. I've been refunded for one pair and now waiting for my refund on the second pair. In short, be very careful ordering from them, especially if it's a special gift. Terrible customer care & service. That's the last menswear order I'll be placing with them! Shocking.",1,ASOS,8

They said it would be actioned but it clearly wasn't. They asked me to prove that we had the conversation before but but no copy of the conversation is routinely sent out when a chat is initiated via the website so placing the emphasis upon me was wholly inappropriate. 

They also did not know what the sole of an ASOS designed shoe is made of, despite the fact they designed it. That borders on the ridiculous. 

Furthermore, successive customer service representatives responded to the chat having clearly not properly read what had gone before because they were constantly trying to end the conversation when it was premature to do so. They also made me repeat myself.",1,ASOS,9

I did spend £110 on order 408481734 bought from Asos, but they refuse to keep their word on price promise. Guess what? If this does not get resolved, I will buy it from Next.

I received an SMS at 7am saying my order couldn't be delivered today and to contact ASOS. 

I contacted ASOS and they initiated a 'return to sender' request at 1am. They said my order will be returned to them and I'll be given a refund.

I have never had a company sell me a product with guaranteed next day delivery and then stop my order from reaching me at 1am, I'm simply lost for words.

I've now got no present to give to a loved one and have purchased the same item from a competitor of ASOS who have guaranteed me next day delivery. ASOS asked me to order from them again but if they don't know why they cancelled my order as it was being delivered last time then it is likely to happen again.

I was a brand new customer who had never purchased from ASOS before, this was the first transaction and the start of our relationship. I would give them 0 stars if possible. I wish I had checked their review ratings - they are rated terrible for a reason, please do yourself a favour and buy from a more caring and organised company.

I wanted to make a formal complaint, I was told that I had to do it using their website which is more for troubleshooting. After much hassle I wrote a complaint.
The person completely ignored all of my written text and treated me as though I was a happy customer checking on their order - very poor.
The response I received is below:



Thanks for contacting us at ASOS. Sorry to hear you didn't receive your order 388914318 and it's being returned to us.

I've checked your order for you and it's on its way back to our warehouse due to you explaining you wouldn't need this order unless it arrived at a certain point.
We're unable to resend your order to you. As soon as we've received the parcel, we'll refund the cost of the items and send you an email to let you know.
Please allow 7 working days for your parcel to arrive at our warehouse and be processed. We'll drop you an email when it’s been done. It may take 5-10 working days for funds to show in your account.

If you haven't received a returns confirmation email by the 22nd of February let us know and we can look into this for you.
I'm really sorry your order didn't reach you. If you still want the items and they're still available, please order them through our website as normal as I'm unable to place your order for you, for security reasons. An easy way to do this is to log into your account, view the original order and then add the items you want back into your shopping bag.

We make every effort to ensure that you receive your orders on time and are happy with our service. I'm really sorry you're being asked to wait a little longer; occasionally there are postal delays which are outside our control.

If you have any more queries in the meantime, get back in touch and I'd be more than happy to help.

Best Wishes,",1,ASOS,9

Half of the products on order are now out of stock, the other half are obviously full price.
I had numerous chats with customer service, who were ""at a loss"" with what happened, and despite my pleas not to cancel my order and redeliver, nobody got in touch with me since.

Nice little scam for Asos- who are obviously struggling with cash flow, to bump up their sales for Black Frdiay with investors.",1,ASOS,10

SuzieQ,2019-09-09T17:22:57Z,Apparently I had signed for a lost delivery!,"I paid for next evening delivery and waited in. Nothing arrived except for a text confirming delivery!

I called them and they advised that it had been delivered and I had signed for it - which clearly I hadn't. They then told me to knock on neighbours doors etc despite telling me I had signed for it.

The next day I rang again and they advised they dpd confirmed that I had signed for it and they delivered to my address. If I was disputed I needed to provide all sorts of evidence proving that I had not signed for the package.

The next day a kind man who lived some 6 streets away arrived with the parcel advising he had found this outside his door by almost falling over it.

I advised asos and no apology or anything remotely resembling this, despite me being a loyal and longstanding customer.

Following an email from ASOS on a promo for an extra 10%, i went online and ordered some items, like a fool i forgot to use the checkout code for the extra discount amount.

If you've made a mistake, you're able to cancel the order yourself but you have to be quick about it.""

This is my first experience using them so won’t be back. They also asked me to check the delivery address when it is one of their pick up points so surely they should know if it’s correct not me, completely illogical.",1,ASOS,10

They accepted my order and sent me a dispatch notification later that evening. Ten minutes AFTER the dispatch notification they sent me a 2nd email saying the trousers, the only reason I'd made the order,  were not in stock! It then took me 3 weeks speaking to some of the rudest customer service personnel I've ever encountered, who by the way told me I couldn't speak to a supervisor or make a complaint, to eventually get a refund.

ASOS as a brand is going downhill and I can now see why. They’re more interested in sending automated responses as opposed to actually understand customer issues and properly looking into them. Changing their couriers as well resulting in a number if delays, even though you chose and pay for next day delivery, and then their staff have the audacity to say wait till midnight to see if the item gets delivered?

Dissatisfaction: The order didnt arrive as advised, followed up with the customer care team on 18th Dec to be informed the matter had been passed to the “Specialist Team” and a response would be received within 8 days....... followed up again on 19th Dec and advised the order was Christmas gifts so waiting upto 8 days didnt make sense. Couple hours later received email stating “we’ve received your returned items”. Followed up again with the team and was told various different stories “items were out of stock”, “order couldnt be found in the warehouse” etc etc funnily enough a simple click back onto the website showed the items were in stock however funnily enough they had reverted back to their original prices (surprise surprise). Asked on multiple occasions for the matter to be escalated - however it seems apparently Asos do not have a dedicated complaints / escalations team as the Customer Care team handle such matters - this is questionable.

Conclusion: The Customer Care team require training on what it actually means to “care” for customers. Also honesty is always the best policy.",1,ASOS,10

Guillelma de Rosers,2019-07-15T08:57:37Z,Enough is enough. This is really bit worth it.,"I had never realised how many bad reviews Asos had in most reviews websites, including this one. 
I have had many bad experiences with Asos in the past, but I have always given them another chance because of the Pros:

- next day delivery
- easy way to return items

However, pros become weaker when there are so many issues and for me, this is the last time.

I hope this can help someone to avoid the struggle and so much time-consuming that bad service represents.

I recently ordered 2 items and paid extra to have them delivered Next Day Evening. 
The item was shipped 4 days after the order was placed. In that time, since it was a very important order (otherwise I wouldn't have paid extra for a such specific delivery), I contacted Customer Services via email, chat, Messenger and IG:

- IG messages: these were deleted by Asos without giving an answer and there were very polite messages (I would never think of swearing, insulting, etc. when writing CS since I have worked many years in the industry and I know how hard it can be at times). I have encountered other people that had had this in the past, but deep inside I thought that they had sworn or being rude, etc. But obviously, asking for help is not tolerated that well.

- Messenger: noone read my message until 6 days after my order was placed (and finally received). Their notes say that they reply to you within 24h. Busier times? Increase the team; I am sure that a billion-pound business can afford to have a large enough customer service force?

- chat: I was disconnected 3 times and the time someone didn't cut me off and really try to help they said that they were not prepared to deal with queries that they just know about what is in stock.

- email: no one replied to me until the day my parcel was shipped and they blamed the courier saying that they could not control if the courier was not delivering the item (wrong, to be honest, it is the responsibility of the sender to make sure the item arrives - but this is another thread). I know courier services are very unreliable most of the time, but blaming someone for something they are not responsible for it is simply bad practice and pretty unfair on the courier service.

In the end, I received my parcel 5 days after order it, 4 days after the scheduled, paid, specific delivery. So I decided to return the items since they were no longer needed. 
Well, issues continue:

- I requested a refund for the Next Day Evening Delivery and after several attempts, someone said they had issued the refund back to my Paypal, 2 weeks later I am still waiting and nothing has hit my account. 

- The parcel I sent back (thanks to having a tracking number from Royal Mail) was delivered exactly 48h after sending it out. No refund has been received and it has also been over 10 working days (which it the limit Asos asks you to wait for), 2 weeks in total. Noone knows anything.

I hope I can solve this issue and I get both my refunds so I can finally close my account with Asos and stop using them altogether.

You reach a point whereby you expect a service to be as good as what a retailer can offer you to sell; unfortunately, Asos has the worst Customer Service I have ever encountered both in my professional career and as a customer. 
Customer Service is not an easy job (I've been there), but the attitude of some advisors is appalling and Asos definitely doesn't seem to invest in training to have people ready and available to help customers on the spot. Customers spend their money and they deserve being treated properly and helped when needed. For Asos £100 order/refund might be nothing, but for customers, this is money (a lot, for some) they have probably worked very hard to get to spend £100 and having such bad experience is really daunting and unfair.

I wouldn't say ""don't use them"", but if I was new I would make sure I checked people's experiences to understand if it's worth it in the long run. 

I am definitely not using them again.",1,ASOS,10
Stephen Borland,2018-12-12T20:47:49Z,ASOS sent me a box which had been tampered with and the item stolen then refused to compensate me.,"I ordered a watch for my son's christmas present via ASOS last week on line.  I thought i had  ordered clothes from them previously without incident but have now realised I was a first time customer. The parcel was delivered by Royal mail. The external packaging was intact although ridiculously large for the size of the item which was a wrist watch. I was surprised to find the dress box for the watch out of its plastic packaging and flopping about in the large box. When I opened this I foung a geniune Armani booklet and watch mount but no watch. ASOS do no provide a direct telephone customer support service. I have emailed them with no response. I have facebook messaged them with a response that they have acknowledged contact and will be in touch but no time scale. I have retained all packaging and my fear is they will counter that we are laying a false claim of theft in transit. The bottom line is that I will have go to a shop and buy my son his gift ahead of the big day and be out of pocket twice.
Today I received the following response from ASOS
ello,

After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a replacement of your item:

- Armani Exchange AX2099 Chronograph Gold Stainless Steel Strap Watch

It’s very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  

In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  

In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. 

As we’re unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response Stephen.


Best Wishes,

Customer Verification Team

So not only am I now out of pocket, I have had my character assassinated insinuating that I am a fraudster. This is a complete stonewall. It stands to reason there is a weight difference in a box dispatched with a watch in it and a box arriving at its destination without it .",1,ASOS,10

So I asked ASOS the following…

Me: Please deliver to a different address.
ASOS.	No

Me: Please reattempt delivery.
ASOS: No

Me: Please credit my account so I can re-order the items as a priority, as I need for a gift,  (as you now know the items are on the way back to you.)
ASOS: No

Me: So what you are basically saying, is tough luck! We’ve taken your money, you can’t have it back for two weeks (7 WORKING days + 1 Bank holiday + 2 weekends), you don’t have the items you ordered, and we won’t do anything for the inconvenience as I’m hiding behind a ‘policy’
ASOS Basically yes

Me: OK, I’ll vent my frustration of your poor customer service on trust pilot. Are you sure you can’t do anything to help me, as I can’t afford to re-order YOU failed to deliver prior to you refunding me. The error is YOURS not mine.

Hermes who are Asos chosen delivery company failed to delivery, and now I have zero idea as to whether the item will be delivered or not. 

Asos deliberately upsold this delivery service. If a company can not cope with high demand for delivery or customer service then they shouldn't offer a service and should definitely not be willing to take a customers hard earned money for something they can not guarantee.

MAOUDI,2019-02-11T11:03:43Z,Customer Service is basically a template email response!,"After placing my order and paying almost GBP 20 for express international service I received an email from the courier company with the tracking number except the tracking number lead me to a page that states that my package was delivered in July 2018. I contacted customer service who stated that as per the courier there is no record of my shipment but as per Asos I should receive my order by the 14th of Feb.  I am not sure why or how the customer service representative thought that his email would in anyway comfort me or resolve my issue if he stated that the courier has no record of my shipment. I continued to correspond with customer service and every time a different person replied but using the same template email stating that if I do not get my package on Feb 14th then to get in touch. I tried explaining that I would no longer need the package after that date and that the reason I paid for express shipping for an item that cost the same as the shipping is because I needed it urgently. The response I received was mind blowing they stated "" if you no longer need the item after late arrival then you can return it"".  Again I am not sure how that was the solution when all I needed were the correct tracking details and to be sure that my package existed and was shipped. Instead of copying and pasting emails maybe someone from customer service could have picked up the phone and called the courier company who ""had no record of my order""! in the end  I did actually receive my order today 11 February, so I guess Asos and their courier service have no clue what they are sending out and when..",1,ASOS,11

Then, I requested an exchange (sizing down) for the hoddie. They say they offer exchange. Now, for some reason, the hoddie (price tagged £65) was refunded as £35 which does not make any sense for two reasons.

First, I requested an exchange and not a refund, the item is still available online and did not run out of the stock at any moment when I was contacting your customer care.

Secondly, even if I requested a refund, I should be eligible for £20 off £125, which mean I would be refunded £55 and not £35.

Bottom line, ASOS owes me either £20 or a size small of that hoddie and I want the hoddie.

Also, for some reason, your customer care are trying to outsmart me and issue me a 2-day £30 discount code that only applicable on purchase of £175!!! This is ridiculous, it is not a big company manner, but a street dealers!!

They have never cared about customer service but stupidly I have continued to shop with them. This last experience has been so bad that I’ve just had to cut them off, I used to shop 4 times a month on average and spend hundreds each year. They’ve been so rude and treated me with such contempt that it just has to end. They’ll get no more money from me. I work in retail and everyone I know feels the same. It’s a real shame they can’t/won’t sort this out as they really could be an amazing company.",1,ASOS,12

I have been a 4 year costumer in Zalando. Unfortunately, I moved to a country that zalando is not there. So I went with asos. On my first order there was no return stick and when I contact them they said that I have to print it. So I have to spent time for their mistake. Disappointing. Also the person on the costumer support chat was really rude.

I received confirmation the delivery would be between 6and 10pm 28th November   .
The live tracker is not accurate nor has it updated through out yesterday evening or up to 530pm today 29th  . The items did not arrived as promised either and it’s now 530 on 29th and I am still no wiser as to when they will appear .

When I tried. to email ASOS to find out where my order is - because the tracking link does not work the mail will not send and although it allows for live chat connection that also does not work
So now I am left with no order 
No way to contact ASOS and I am out of pocket for the same day delivery charge 
Totally forgot unacceptable service from ASOS 
And not recommended you pay extra for sameday delivery

Update at 5.30pm 29th ASOS still cant tell me where my parcel is nor when I will receive it .
I have had two condescending emails today neither addressing my complaint nor giving me any support nor guidance in relation to my delivery . One suggested I wait until 1st December and if the delivery had not been received by this point to contact the ASOS. Costumer services again ! The second simply quoted their delivery “get out policy “and gave no help or advice on my delivery both wishing me a great weekend as a sign off . ? Clearly ASOS customer service training provider needs to review their policies and communication content 

Please be mindful when placing orders with ASOS my suggestion only order if you have no delivery dead line and definitely do not pay extra for anything other than standard delivery and should you have any type of customer service query I’d forget any explanation of getting any relevant and useful delivery information from them 

Totally unacceptable service",1,ASOS,13

I have really lost the trust in company, so I don’t even order clothing from them anymore. 
My advise, if you have any issues, just send the item back, don’t waste your time by contacting customer services.
Answer to all the issues seems to be “just send the items back“.

Customer services is no use half of the time ether...

I ordered some boots recently and parcel has not been delivered. Decided to contact customer services- guess what, they told me exactly what I already knew. Parcel has not been delivered!
Then they told me to wait another week and a bit, because it might arrive by that date!

Asos customer support were unable to offer me anything, even the slightest discount on a larger pair as a gesture of goodwill.
Look, I know this was my fault, but the trousers were expensive (£50). Would it kill them to treat customers like human beings and go beyond what is expected of them? I’d have been happy with 10% off a larger size, which is what they give students anyway. The problem with big corporations like this is that greed trumps everything else.

I have contacted them about 20 times-chat,calls,email.
So, they have told me that basically I am lying and kept the parcel.I sent proof of posting and screenshot that its been delivered on 17June by them. But they have closed my account and because of that didn't want to speak to me anymore since the customer care have no more existing account with me.
I asked to speak to their security team that made that decision -the answer was -they don't have email or phone number.

Victoria ,2019-07-25T22:34:34Z,Gone from bad to worse.,"Ordered last year, a week in advance for some items to arrive for a festival- they came 8 days later, one day too late.
 Then I bought something with the 'next day delivery' for a year, it came at about 9 pm but it was the next day at least. When I tried to order again with my 'one-year unlimited next day delivery' I was told I'd just purchased a one-off, despite the unlimited and one-off deliveries being the same price (£7.99). Thought it was a bit of a scam, never really had that issue with other companies before and wouldn't have paid £7.99 for one-off next day because I didn't need it urgently. 
Left it about 10 months before I purchased from them again, ordered some boots expected to be here today. Ordered Monday. Need them by Saturday, was told to wait until 11.59pm to contact them again, to be told they're having issues with the courier. If they told me that earlier I would have ordered the boots again, with next day delivery. Now I don't have that option, I've come to vent my opinion. Been told to wait until the 5th of August!!
Their shipping has gone way downhill and I don't think I will ever be purchasing again. Deleting the app and saving myself the hassle. Wish I'd never bothered. I very rarely leave bad feedback and I understand companies make mistakes but three times now in less than a year when I've only made 3 orders? I understand it may be the courier's fault (Hermes) but don't mislead your customers by saying their items will be here on a certain day and not following through with that. The 5th of August is 2 weeks from my order date, plus I never got a shipping email, only an order confirmation. I used to always order from ASOS, they were my go-to.

Christina Arguile,2019-06-15T12:54:00Z,You can tell a lot about a company from the way they treat their customers.,"If you want to place an order with ASOS you better hope you don’t have any problems, their customer service is abysmal and they genuinely don’t care. Had a gift card due to expire so used it to purchase an item which I ended up returning for a smaller size. The smaller size was still out of proportion and of poor quality so returned it for a refund. The gift card was added back to my account but have only just found out it expired only 2 weeks later?? When questioning expiry dates and terms and conditions I have not been listened to and the same statements have been made time and again without actually answering my questions. I will not be using them again and encourage others to do the same. I will also be exercising my rights under GDPR and having my details removed from their systems.",1,ASOS,17

Daniel Cleaves,2019-11-20T17:04:54Z,WARNING ABOUT AN ASOS PLOY,"I have been a customer of ASOS for many years, however since they decided to change strategy around refunds/deals etc things have been going down. 

But this latest one is not so much a scam but a devious ploy that I think will make them £Millions. 

ASOS used to offer a straight 20% off but recently it changed to £30 off when you spend £170 which wasn't far off 20% so I bought some items.

However when some jeans arrived they didn't fit I sent them back - something ASOS have always been great for. 

However 3 weeks later I hadn't heard a thing so I called them to be told they are keeping the jeans, as the £30 off was when I spent £170 this meant that there was no discount !!!!! I asked if I could have a larger size and was told this wasn't possible, I asked for maybe vouchers or credit to buy something else and again was told this is not possible. 

So if I hadn't gone out of my way to post the jeans back I would still have them in my possession but because i posted them back I lose the jeans and my £28... 

I wonder how many other people this will happen to? 

Are ASOS banking on this to make them a quick extra profit? 

The staff seemed to jump immediately to our Ts&Cs state this (they were changed recently) 

Its almost as if this was a strategic move... and I bet its made a lot of money",1,ASOS,19

If they send the wrong item to you and want a refund you have to wait a month before you get your money back. First you have to pick it up for a warehouse, resend the item which can take a week or more then this “It can take up to 14 working days to arrive back at our warehouse” “funds will show in your account within 5-10 working days of the refund being completed.” 100% their mistake but offer nothing in return.

Jay Parmar,2019-04-05T14:12:24Z,The worst customer service I have ever encountered.,"I can see why Asos have a 1 star rating, their customer service is an absolute joke. If your order is picked correctly with no damage then its fine however you come across a small problem like I did then you are given lies and misleading advice.

I was incorrectly refunded when I requested an exchange for a damaged item however they removed the £10 code I used which expected me to spend £80 and refunded me £3. I got in contact and expected to have been provided a new code to reorder the incorrect refund so this could be rectified. How wrong was i.

It seems Asos create their own rules or their advisor's are just dumb. They gave me a new code of £10 but slapped on a £80 minimum spend on an item which which was refunded is £13. Got back in contact with them on Twitter and was given another £5 code which again is useless as this doesn't even cover the cost of the item I wanted and leaves me having to fork out for their error.

After trying to explain this to them I seem to be getting thick advisor's who spin around the same template saying ""oh, stock levels must have been low"" NO THE ITEM WAS, AND STILL IS IN STOCK!"". I can see why they don't liaise over the phone, just imagine having to speak to people with this kind of idiocy over the phone. They would get eaten alive. 

I had one chat advisor saying she cannot assist me further and even gave me the ""your chat will be ended if you don't respond in 5 minutes"" because she was too stupid to resolve my simple query.

Save yourself the hassle and don't order from Asos, I know I won't be anymore.",1,ASOS,19

I've always loved their clothes and customer service, until the last couple of years. I always order large orders of £100-£300 because I've been losing weight and don't always know what size I am. Normally I try everything on and send back what doesn't fit or suit me. Lately Asos haven't been fully processing my large orders, leaving me with massive bills and then I have to call and email back and forth for days, sometimes weeks to explain that the whole order was in one bag and why hasn't my whole refund been processed. I have now filed an official complaint after being asked to pay £115, when I should in fact be paying £42. This happens only on large orders, where there is more than one Returns form. This has also started happening to friends of mine who also use Asos. After being a loyal customer for 18 years, I've asked them how to shut down my account. It's just not worth the hassle. You get no apology, no compensation and it's time consuming.",1,ASOS,23

Lew Whalley,2019-05-01T08:50:12Z,Absolutely appalling x10000,"Wow, how bad have ASOS become?!?!

For starters, they *used* to use DPD for their next day service. A brilliant courier, never any issues whatsoever. Could choose your own delivery slot, driver was always on time, was literally NEVER late in all the 100+ times I used ASOS' next day option.

Who have they started using now, as a mere cost cutting exercise..?
DHL Parcel UK, (a.k.a UK Mail with a new frock on).

As most of us know, UK Mail are widely regarded as one of the most tragically shambolic couriers ever to grace the planet. Constant delays for no apparent reason, drivers not showing up, awful tracking, little-to-no delivery notifications etc etc.

So ASOS' premier delivery (i.e. next day delivery for a year) has gone from being absolutely superb, to downright obsolete, as the courier will likely never actually deliver on the next day.
So save yourself a tenner and don't bother signing up to that garbage.

Secondly - their customer service... wow.
I don't think I've ever experienced such a can't-be-bothered attitude from customer service staff?

It does beg the question: why on earth do they actually hire these people on chat?
You may as well chat to your nearest wall about your order/delivery as it will be able to assist just as much as ASOS' live chat team.

I spoke to an absolute cretin called Jasmitha, who literally had no idea what she was banging on about.
No help whatsoever, she may as well have been replying in some sort of indigenous Papuan language, spoken only by tribes untouched by the western world, as that would've probably made more sense to me than the drivel she was spouting about my delivery.

Oh and they won't offer any sort of apology/discount/reimbursement no matter how much they mess you about, so don't waste your time asking.

As I said earlier, ASOS used to be great, my go-to site if I needed to grab a few bits of clothing quickly.
Now, I shall be shopping elsewhere, as there *must* be better options out there.

My previous order from them was cancelled due to one item not being in stock - even though they were clearly available on the website. Not compensation or anything. Just a horribly arrogant customer care person.

But my last order really made me reconsider every using ASOS again. They simply do not care - at all. I purchased a lot of clothes from them - and to make sure the order would get to me in time I payed for next day delivery. When I didn't get the order by evening on the promised date of delivery I contacted the customer support. But he wouldn't help me until the next day! He would not even look into the case until the following day! - he wouldn't even confirm whether my items was shipped or not. Today I contacted the customer service again.

The ASOS customer service team were really unhelpful, failed to answer even the simplest question (why is the parcel delayed?) and instead just kept telling me what the tracking update said. Obviously could not be bothered to deal with any customer enquiry first hand.

After 6 days, I told them I was no longer interested in receiving the items, they were too late, I was told then that it would take up to two weeks for the return and another 2 weeks to get my refund, so ASOS just have hold of my money for up to 6 weeks now.

Sofie Johansen,2019-06-28T14:12:30Z,Worst asos expierence ever - on my 50+ order,"Has anyone else ordered “next-day-delivery” for a year, and The first order never came? 
I’ve made an order The 21th, which should be delivered The 24th. But it never came, and hasn’t been marked as “sent” it’s still “we’ve Got it”, NOT “we’ve sent it”. And there aint no tracking available. I’ve contacted customer service serval times, and asos sent me an e-mail The 24th to let me now it was one day delayed, and if I didn’t have it next day i should contact them again - so I did! Because it never came. Everyone writes “i will look into this” but I never Got any further messages. So I contacted The chat - where “JOE” claims my package has been delivered, but won’t give me any tracking number to proof it. I’ve been looking everywhere outside, been asking neighbours and contacted UPS and PostNord (local postoffice) but as long as i don’t have any tracking number they can’t help me. They tell me to contact asos - which I’ve done EVERY single day, with no help. It’s my 50+ order - so i’m a loyal customer and have been it for many years. When i try to e-mail customer service and choose The order I don’t have (but Asos claims has been delivered) it even says : “it looks like our costumer Care team need to help you with this one - just fill out the box below with any more information and submit your query.”
This plus The “we’ve Got it” in-sted of “we’ve sent it” should be proof enough to listen to me. But they don’t. And I can’t check with post offices or UPS before asos are giving me a tracking number. 
Anyone else tried it? And how did it go? To me The 1000 dkkr spent on something i’m not getting is many money, it was a summer cheer up gift, but now it’s The most frustrating thing ever, having to write mails every day, with The same answers and no action. Didn’t thought asos would ever be my worst internet shopping nightmare. It was my fav place. This experience really broke my heart.",1,ASOS,81
NWA,2019-05-29T08:06:00Z,My delivery is still missing,My delivery is still missing. The items should have been delivered several days ago and it is impossible to send ASOS an e-mail.,1,ASOS,85
Felicia,2019-01-14T00:14:00Z,Customer Service is terrible and will cost you a lot of money.,"I have had many small squabbles with Asos, because there is almost always a little problem with any order. But I looked past it because solving it would not be worth the effort it would take and because ultimately the prices so cheap.

However, it has happened REGULARLY that they claim to not have received my returns, so you want to hang on to your receipts for dear life or you lose everything. In total, I have probably lost well over 300  pounds because Asos claimed they didn't get my returns.

This time, however, was even worse; I ordered a few items for my upcoming vacation two weeks before my flight. I purposefully checked the tracking info and stayed in 2 days in a row, not leaving my flat, waiting for my parcel. Asos sent me emails 3 times claiming I was not in and they could not deliver the parcel, however, both I and my flatmates were in the house and we KNOW that a delivery truck probably didn't even pull up (we would have heard that).

So I contact Customer Service and tell them the issue. By this point, 7 days have passed. They say they cannot redirect the order to be re-sent to me; it's their policy that after 3 ""failed"" delivery attempts, the order goes back to the warehouse and is processed as a return. I make sure to understand this correctly; they said I'd have to reorder all the items I wanted again in a different, separate order because the first parcel was definitely going to be processed as a return and I would receive my money back for that. To make sure, I did tell them I was not going to be in much longer as I was going on holiday and they said they understood and would not send me anything.
(A side note here; the customer support person was incredibly rude and passive-aggressive. The lady later was nice, but still unhelpful.)

Fast forward to today; 16 days after first placing the order,  it has reappeared and was delivered while I am on holiday. I am not going to be back for a month and when I tell Customer Support about the issue, they say there is nothing they can do and that if I want to return anything after I am back from my holiday, I would maybe get a gift voucher.

I am incredibly upset because I did nothing wrong in this situation and Asos does absolutely not care. And they never do, so do yourselves a favour and shop somewhere else - Asos' prices are not worth the headache and in 80% of cases, you'll probably want to return stuff anyway; and that is where the real nightmare starts.",1,ASOS,118

The parcel was my partners only Christmas gifts. 
I moved here o the Netherlands in October and we only back here for Christmas. I thought it would be a good idea buying presents in the uk rather having to bring them all with from The Netherlands. My two pairs of trainers was meant to be delivered on on the 19th December to my friends address. We flew into stansted on 20th December to find that it was still not delivered. I contacted ASOS and yodel. Yodel told me that it was at their Basildon depo so I arranged to go and collect it on the 21st December. When I got there at the Basildon depo in the morning of the 21 December they made me aware that it is missing and that I have to contact ASOS for a refund or another trainers send. I was also told I would be compensated for the long phone calls and petrol I had spend driving there. I then contacted ASOS again but the person I spoke to was not that helpful and told me I’ve got to contact yodel again to get them to contact ASOS. By this time I’ve spend an hour ringing back and forth. I’ve still got no present to give and nothing is resolved. 
ASOS is quick to take the money for goods but when there is an issue with lost items it takes days to resolve. ASOS should not use unreliable delivery companies. Or give a specific date for a delivery when it can’t promise that service. This is ASOS responsibility to ensure that their products reach clients safely and on time of date that was given. I never got compensation from either companies. I got two new pairs send but had to pay for next day delivery, so extra costs on top of the previous order. When it did arrive on the 24th December ASOS send them wrong pair of trainers. What a waste of money and time.",2,ASOS,1

It wasn't until speaking to this last person that I was informed that there had been an error in the warehouse. Out of all the people I have spoken to this could have been explained to me earlier.

Charles,2019-12-14T15:32:13Z,Indifferent after repeated delivery issues.,"I used to enthusiastic recommend shopping with ASOS to friends and family. Their Premier Delivery subscription was a great service until the issue began. Anytime ASOS sent my delivery by Hermes I learned to brace myself for problems. 

Items were consistently late - very rarely, if ever, arriving on time. Packages arrived tampered with (opened and resealed), with items missing, or having clearly been mistreated. This issue persisted every time Hermes were the courier company used. (Note: I did not experience any of these issues when DPD were the couriers used).

The negative review of ASOS is due to their indifference to the issues. Time & time again, it happened & each time, I would contact them to notify them of the issues. Each time I'd receive an apathetic response. Not once was there any real understanding of my frustration, nor any offer of any compensation. They'd offer to replace the items, but with no comprehension of the frustration and disappointment I'd experience, nor the time lost to constantly tracking items & trying to contact them.

Most recently, I received no response via their Facebook messenger chat option, no response via their Twitter support team, no response via their e-mail contact form before finally finding away to initiate a live chat on their website. The representative there was polite, but indifferent & again - despite explaining my disappointment & how I was unlikely to renew my premier delivery membership or continue shopping with them, I was essentially dismissed with my only options being waiting for a replacement (if stock allows) or a refund. Very often the items ordered were for gifts, and therefore there was a time sensitivity to receiving the items. Despite there premier delivery service offering unlimited 1-day delivery, it seemed to them it was reasonable to have me wait upwards of a week for items I had paid for. 

The end result is my view of the company is tarnished as it seems they have taken no responsibility despite repeated issues.",2,ASOS,1

It should not be advertised as a two piece set and if so, it should have had “items sold separately” parentheses so that it is clear to the buyer. I feel like I was tricked into buying two $40 pair of shorts that I would have never brought if that was the case. I am set to leave out of the country next week and I now I have to spend more money to replace what I thought I would have received from you guys. Overall this was a very disappointing experience and I don’t think I will be doing business with you guys again until I see improvement.

Maybe I could wait and re-buy it as it had also now gone down by 20%. I asked if I could be given a small refund to compensate for the damage- we're talking 10%. No, can't do that, but I can have a discount code for 10% off a full price item. No thank you! why should I be out of pocket. Another option for me was I could submit a dry cleaning receipt and claim it back from asos- face palm! do you know the cost of dry cleaning? it would be more than a few quid that I had asked for in a refund out of good will which I would probably get at a till in any store in the UK. I asked about your dry cleaning refund limits and no information could be provided but you might not pay what I am quoted anyway. Utterly stupid solution to an easy to sort problem.  My options are now, wait and see if the coat comes back in stock to exchange, refund or go and take time off work to go and get a quote for a dry cleaner which you might not even pay anyway.

Recent changes to United States operations have been abysmal, unfortunately, and I would no longer recommend supporting the company in the US due to the following reasons:
1) USPS shipping was suddenly and secretly removed for returns. Customers could choose between UPS and the convenience of a USPS home pickup. Suddenly, only UPS is available. When talking to customer service, I was told to walk 30 minutes to a UPS drop-off location with my return.
2) Orders arrive by inconsistent carriers and are frequently delayed.
3) The ""What's new"" assortment is no longer relevant for US shoppers. It is a mess of random product and not the assortment that UK users see.
4) Quality of product has declined. 

I don't know who is responsible for operations in Georgia, but it has been messy and disappointing. I'm hoping to give ASOS another chance given their amazing extended sizing, but they will no longer be my go-to fashion destination and I worry for their future as a company.

I also don't have vehicular transport, so I have to locate and go to the nearest UPS dropoff site by foot). 

In terms of the product, the zipper tends to get stuck near the belt area, but when it is on, it looks good. It is very form-fitting, so be warned of that.

I can conclude that the international system/ delivery is not as good, after purchasing at least 30 times in the past. Wrong/ missing item, was told product is not available after receiving confirmation email about the order etc. Besides, some products cannot be shipped to certain countries due to contract signed between asos and the supplier (informed about this). The UK system is better than international as it allows exchange within certain time and also better packing/ logistics service.

Recently I’ve experienced some hassle about discount issue, which is a bit ridiculous to me since they’ll take away the whole discount for the order when you return some of the items, i.e. the things you keep has none of the discount from the order you placed with discount code because of some T&Cs. This is confusing as you only know when the discount works or not when they send you back the refund which is like 2 weeks+ after you make the return then there’s no time for you to make another return if you change your mind.

A quick google search shows that the company Couriers Please has a 1.3 star rating with thousands of negative reviews and yet they were selected as part of ASOS's supply chain. 3 phone calls, 2 missed deliveries and 2 journeys out to their public lockers - this is all the effort required on my part before I was told the quickest way to get the items was to drive out to their depot. It is now going to be 5 days since the promised delivery date and I honestly can't say whether I'm guaranteed to receive it. I really think from a customer satisfaction perspective, ASOS MUST review their use of Couriers Please. I think that a courier company that requires ME to drive to THEM is a complete failure of a company",2,ASOS,1

I could see the parcel was at the Manchester depot and when I finally got through to someone they said I had to wait and see what happened, only for the delivery to fail at 6pm, after I'd confirmed the address, postcode and given my phone number so the courier could contact me.

Ricardo Boavida,2019-10-15T11:53:10Z,Unhelpful Costumer Service,"Very poor customer service. They were nice so there's that.. But honestly, that was the only saving grace.
So, why did I contact Costumer Service in the first place? I tried to complete an order but my payment method got rejected. I went back to the previous web page, tried putting in a different payment method, but when I tried to confirm, the payment was rejected because the item was out of stock (even though Asos reserves the items for one hour when you are finalising your shopping). I spoke with a person nicknamed Summer, explained the situation and asked if it would be possible to check what had happened, for the dress to have gone out of stock. Summer said that she was unable to check anything aside from what was stated in the item's web page (""out of stock"" basically).So then, I asked her if she could speak with someone that could see if the dress I had ordered was maybe in some weird checkout limbo still waiting for my payment. Again she said that she could not do that for me. So then, I asked her if they would get that item back, to which she had no knowledge of either. She simply suggested that I keep refreshing the page and maybe they will have it back in stock. Without any hope, I asked my final question: ""I understand that you can get stock back for multiple reasons such as somebody cancelling an order, or somebody returning an item, but what is usually the time where you get most of your stock back?"". Unsurprisingly, her response was that she doesn't have that information and that she can't ask anyone from a department that does know that info. 

TL;DR: I contacted ASOS because of a failed order and they were unable to provide any information concerning: Why the item had not been reserved; If the item was still reserved but I simply could not see it; if they would get it back; when does ASOS usually get/update their stock? My question is, what do they know then?",2,ASOS,1

I had checked the terms & conditions of the promo offer and I had ordered a full priced item that was shipping to Australia so my order met the conditions to be able to get the full 25% discount - so it was an error on ASOS's part. I tried to chat to Customer Service shortly after and was put through to Emily....before she even said anything I was notified through the chat that ""you're now chatting to Larisa"". I was confused as to what happened but nevertheless, went on to describe the issue to Larisa again, only to have her end the chat with me right then and there. This is the equivalent to hanging up on your customer right after hearing their issues. I then had to go through the chat room again and spoke to Kevin who advised that I'd need to call back in about 1 hour because he couldn't see the order in your system - I couldn't do this because it was already past midnight my time. I then had to contact customer service again for the third time the next morning and spoke to Andrew who admitted that I was incorrectly charged for my order and advised that I will need to contact customer service again after I receive the item, so that you can refund the difference in the amount to me as the order can no longer be amended. This means that by the time I resolve the issue (which is completely an error on your part), I would have had to contact ASOS Customer Service FOUR TIMES. With the first two times involving Emily and Larisa who completely ignored me and effectively hung up on me - this is the part that angers me most. If it wasn't for Andrew who in the end tried his best to be helpful, I would have rated ASOS Customer Service 1 star. I haven't purchased from ASOS in a while and this has just reminded me again of why I have moved on to other online retailers such as Revolve and Shopbop. Ridiculous!!!!",2,ASOS,1

Clearly, I wasnt able to cancel it. Second, I sought help from your customer service live chat. As expected, they only gave me the same answer whereby you guys cannot do anything about instances like this. My only concern is that someone else receives it for me then that person takes the parcel and goes jolly home with his/her new items. You didn't provide me with any solution. It's like you only care about being able to pack to parcel and have it shipped and fulfilled. Making sure it ends up to the right person is already off your hands. You can only hope that it does. It's disappointing as I am left with just hoping the person that receives it will have the kind heart to find me and pass the parcel to me (which I highly doubt).

K P,2019-10-04T11:46:09Z,No Customer Loyalty,"I purchased a pair of pants that were not part of any promotion.

I speak to customer service via chat where I am told that a price adjustment cannot be created for me since there are no exchanges in the US.
I find that extremely unfair. I have already given my business and intended to again, but rather than good customer service ASOS is only about getting money.
Where is the customer loyalty in forcing me to pay extra for an item? 
Asos has cute styles which is the only reason I still shop from time to time but the returns process is a big pain. 
Purchasing is also frustrating when limited to 60 minutes to browse for items in such a vast collection. As I'm searching & shopping through categories much of my cart gets released back, causing confusion in my order or me giving up and not purchasing anything in frustration. 

ASOS needs to change these 2 facets of its business design or customer loyalty will wane and they'll certainly lose business.",2,ASOS,1
Julia,2019-10-08T08:54:50Z,A total mess,"There are so many things wrong with this site I don’t even know where to start...

I was looking to buy a pair of the white Nike Shox TL sneakers (worth $270 AUD) and found them on ASOS reduced to $204 listed as “Nike white Shox Total Sneakers” ...really? Aren’t they supposed to be an English company?

I selected my size (US 8.5) since the size guide indicated “Women” even though the foot measurements made no sense because I checked and my foot is not 27cm... but I decided to test my luck and order them anyway while they were on sale. I continued browsing the other Shox and I see that they’ve got the exact same shoes listed as “Nike Shox TL sneakers in white” (so basically exactly the same shoes just with a more coherent title) with the size guide indicated ”Men”, but with completely different size conversions. Now I’m even more confused. Since I’ve had this exact same problem twice with ASOS before (confusing and inconsistent shoe size conversions) I just gathered that the shoes were unisex and I had actually ordered a men’s 8.5 just advertised for women, so I went and ordered another 7 and a 7.5 from the same listing as I had no idea what I was going to receive.

I had already initiated a return for the 8.5 and received them today, and they did in fact turn out to be women’s. They fit, but there was a yellow STAIN on the top of the right shoe. I checked the listing again to place a new order and now they’re back up to $273?! The shadiness and inconsistency of this site is astounding.

I had a look at the size guide again and finally worked out that the foot measurements only applied to UK SIZES, (which wasn’t stated on the chart) even though you’re ordering in US. So not only are their size guides excruciatingly confusing and disorganised, leading you to order multiple sizes, they’ll go ahead and send you a used, damaged product!

I’m returning all 3 of them, and I won’t bother trying to arrange an exchange for the stained pair or placing another order. I’ll just be going straight to Nike. Even though ASOS have a good range of sneakers, their size guides and general website is a mess and their sales are a scam. I definitely won’t be buying from them again. The only good thing is they’ve already refunded me for the first pair. But seriously, don’t waste your time.",2,ASOS,1

Charlotte Curtin,2019-10-01T09:38:26Z,Strike 3.... out,"I’ve made 3 orders with ASOS. And for the third time my item is faulty. This time, however, is the most frustrating. I just want to send my dress back and receive a replacement but I have to refund it and repurchase. If the UK can have an exchange policy, why can’t Australia? When I mentioned that I need it replaced within 18 days due to a wedding, the online chat person said I can pay extra for express shipping! Why should I have to pay extra for an issue that isn’t my fault? Thankfully I was offered a refund on express shipping once my order has been dispatched. Again, why am I being made to pay in the first place? Maybe ASOS should be a little more on top of their quality control? And maybe there needs to be better processes in place to satisfy dissatisfied customers, on a case by case basis? I’m so frustrated by the clunkiness of the whole experience and most likely won’t shop with ASOS again. 3 strikes and you’re out!",2,ASOS,1
KR,2019-10-10T08:42:48Z,No acknowledgement of Returns and confrontational Customer Service,"Have initiated returns and havent received a confirmation email or note to say the returns has started. 
I had to reach out to the customer services team who in turn seemed extremely confrontational and adamant about waiting for the maximum possible time(7 days) before communicating with them as their warehouse needs that much time to scan the parcel. 
What a waste of my time that is. First I have to connect with them and then wait for another few days till they can confirm that a return has been initiated! 

Surely sending a confirmation of return is not that hard.",2,ASOS,1

It's gone dreadfully downhill in my eyes now- last dress I bought I had to return because it had a hole in but I thought that must have been a fluke then I buy premier next day delivery and order some shoes for work and a corporate event and they still aren't here 4 days later and despite tweeting & live chatting I pretty much got empty apologies and shrugs- when I asked one assistant whether I could assume it wouldn't arrive after 9pm he said it might still arrive after 9pm and I stayed up (I work early shifts)  the twitter team is dreadful they may as well delete it and the live chat are all terrible too when I said I was unhappy one assistant said ""please feel free to close the chat"" I was polite and didn't use any foul language either! I know ASOS are struggling but they need to invest in customer service training or they will get a lot worse. They have lost a long time customer. I would say AVOID and use boohoo or h&m or new look the list is endless-  before asos. not like we aren't spoiled for choice just go to a competitor.",2,ASOS,1
Maria Salazar,2019-10-03T15:48:56Z,ASOS does not own up to its mistakes!,"Given that this company receives MANY orders...you would think whenever the company (or the shipping company it decides to use) makes a mistake...that you, the CLIENT, whom has PAID in full for the service/items...does NOT receive the run around! I reported immediately when my package indicated that it was ""delivered"" had NOT been delivered...I was asked to follow a series of ""steps"" before I was deemed of telling the truth.  After having to go out FULLY OUT of my way...on a trip to my local post office...I had to report for a 3rd time to FINALLY be referred to a ""specialist team"" (this takes 24 hours...or so they say). However, AFTER over 36 hours (because I gave them more than enough time), I reached out again.  Only to be told that I had to wait another 12 hours...surprise, surprise.  Not only have I waited a week just to ""inquire"" about the whereabouts of my package or a resolution...I also asked about the items and if I had an opportunity to place them on my same items ""on hold.""  I was blatantly told ""NO"" and therefore I may not even receive my items and/or they may not even be available....because by the time this whole ""inquire"" finishes...who knows?  At this point, I am going to just request a refund from my banking institution.  I have all the chat transcripts and proof...I even went ahead and personally called FEDEX about the missing package. I think they got to me sooner than ASOS did!  At the end of the day, I know the mistake was the actual driver (that might have delivered it at the wrong address and said person did not have the decency to return it).  I know this because my building has anywhere from 10-20 packages delivered daily (and they are left out in the lobby and no one ever takes them!)  I have never had issues receiving a package until my order with ASOS.  The tedious part has been getting ASOS to assist in resolving my dispute in a reasonable and timely manner.  Beware! If your package ever goes missing....get ready to undergo a serious of obstacle courses/questions to get to a possible resolution!",2,ASOS,1

The deliveries are often late although I have premier delivery and also they are sending the wrong ordered items, I am totally upset I couldn't get my orders on the specified time for my birthday vacation. Biggest disappointment ever and also the customer help live chat are very rude and never give you a solution to the problem, instead they just hover around the question only.

Of those shoes received 2 were very poor quality, and I likely wouldn't have kept them anyway. Asos makes it impossible to send an email or contact customer service in an easy and convenient way. The online form had issues and I was unable to contact them at all. Rather than deal with this frustrating situation I just followed the steps online and mailed everything I ordered back for return. Asos will likely issue the refund having no clue why I wanted a return or what went wrong. They won't be able to correct their mistakes. Guess they do not care. Low prices never overcome horrible service.",2,ASOS,1
Hak Hau Kwok,2019-01-06T01:10:58Z,ASOS failed to honour the replacement policy for a missing item,"Purchased from asos.com a couple of times before without problem. ASOS design is relatively cheap, but you also get a little less quality than what you pay for (despite the lower price). However, customer service is horrific when there is a problem with products or deliveries. I recently purchased a pack of 2 pairs of shorts, 1 pair is missing on delivery. Wrote to customer services, they asked me to return the pair that I received and then I MIGHT get the refund, then I MIGHT be able to reorder them on line. Meanwhile, they are stil selling a single pack of the same shorts on line, but they refused to replace it. There is supposed to be a replacement policy if an item is missing, however, it is considered as a faulty product in my case, hence, replacement policy does not apply. (The most frustrating thing is that they kept refering it as an MISSING item in our numerous emails until I asked for a replacement, then it suddenly became a FAULTY item.) Has anyone had SIMILAR experience?",2,ASOS,1

The dresses are made by the same company, Chi Chi London, but are very different. I feel like I was sent an inferior product on purpose. Customer service was poor as well.

He was showing me how much I bored him and That he did not have time for me. But I was happy when a few days ago the customer care of asos messenger helped me to get my money back. However today when I wanted to order back my stuff I saw that asos shipping fee jumped for 4usd to 31.68 usd. And free shipping from 31.68 to 315 usd. Honestly I live in a small country where the salary is not that great and if the shipping price are jumping that high I prefer to look for another online clothing site, as for us its quite expensive. And when my friends and relatives got to know about it their reaction was the same. I don't think I will ever buy there again.",2,ASOS,1
Bernadette Pereira,2019-04-10T15:55:40Z,Misleading new policy on returns/extension of return period,"Your old return policy was bad enough (ie short) and now the new one claims an extension to 45 days.. but during the extension period, you only get a 'gift card' for your returns.

Jacob,2019-03-09T20:05:22Z,Horrible return process,"So...I'm part of a wedding party and there was some blazer I had to order from Asos. Unfortunately, the blazer (by Noose & Monkey) had a few noticeable marks on the right and left shoulders, so I started to the return / exchange process. First off I was surprised that I had to pay for return shipping, but I was told it would be reimbursed after reviewing the item (so no biggie), but it definitely wasn't clear on their ReBOUND return site (Asos partners/works with I guess). Secondly, I could only find digital communications to deal with them (live chat, email, etc) but no phone, which made the whole process challenging expressing the problem and providing clear options. In comparison to other companies like amazon, zara, etc. (which are great) I found the return process is absolutely atrocious with Asos. I then find out there's none of the item left in my size (i.e. screwed for the wedding), so I'm then stuck with the defects and meanwhile I already kicked off the shipping label return process and paid for the shipping. Given the situation, I conceded and asked for them just to refund the return shipping costs which I didn't utilize / render the services and they were unable to refund the return shipping costs unless I sent the garment in, which wasn't an option given I need to secure for the wedding. Escalated and disputed the charge with Visa to deal with their shenanigans, which based on the ReBOUND terms of conditions and Asos', they're in the wrong. Last time I'll ever purchase anything from them.",2,ASOS,1
Ana Jacobs,2019-07-02T15:53:26Z,Worst Customer Service Ever...like babies behind a computer.,"Today I made a purchase with a promo code for almost $200. Immediately after the purchase completed I noticed it was shipping standard and not express as I had indicated. I engaged chat, which is the only option available b/c unlike the thousands of other online shopping services, they don't have a phone #. Okay. So, the first customer rep said I need to wait an hour b/c my order was ""not in the system"", and then chat back. I did so. The second rep I spoke to was so rude and robotic and just keep quoting policy without any concern, saying I ""missed the cancellation period."" What?! I only missed it b/c of what I was told earlier. Then she started blaming me for entering the promo, but not ""claiming it properly"", and hung up on me mid-chat. I spoke with 3 customer service reps, and only the third was helpful, but by that time it was too late to do anything. This seriously can not be how ASOS treats customers. They couldn't even handle the most basic inquiry. There was literally nothing that could be accomplished. I have no clue why they even have a customer service system. You can't speak with a live person. You can't CHANGE ANYTHING, and the only thing they can do is cancel your order, oh, but only in the first 5min to an hour! ...great selection on ASOS, but worst customer service ever.

My package was very late and still hasn't arrived and I was given mixed dates and lied to about getting a refund on the original date.

I selected ‘deliver to neighbour’ which the delivery driver was incapable off. I then got a slip through the door to say it had been delivered to a shop (2 miles away) after making my own way there twice it wasn’t there. Lots and lots of emails, phone calls to DPD and live chats later I still haven’t got my parcel.

Their solution is to have you reach back out at specified times just to get the same answer... there is nothing we can do we are sorry. It is the most frustrating merry-go-round you will ever get on. The tracking doesn't update and when you do get your package (1-2 weeks late) half of it is good quality and half of it looks like a child picked the material. I can deal with the hit or miss clothes, but the customer service making the already frustrated customer do all the work, and constantly saying reach back in a day or two, only to yet again tell me there is really nothing they can do and they are sorry if I am upset, seems unacceptable to me. Answering the question with a straightforward answer, and not a false promise that someone will fix it in the future would be more satisfying.

Ronja,2018-11-13T07:03:34Z,Goodbye Asos,"Used to be quite pleased with my orders and kept buying clothing for the whole family every couple of months, since selection is generally quite wide and good. I was first very pleased when they started co-operating with Klarna. 

Slowly noticed that name label quality went downhill and communication/marketing to customers was very unpleasant, not at all personalized and didn't feel valued as a customer. Now very silently and surprisingly they added a return fee of 10€ from Finland and that seemed unfair only because it was poorly communicated to customers. If I place 5-8 orders per year and spend quite a lot of my shopping budget to the company, surely they could at least inform customers about this kind of changes.

Roberta,2019-05-31T10:15:27Z,Appalling customer care,"*UPDATE NO. 2*
Two weeks later, nothing's changed. As predicted, now they are telling me to wait until the end of 14th of June. This is actually against the law. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.

*UPDATE*
A week later, nothing's changed. Now they are telling me to allow until the end of 7th June (Friday of course, so they can buy themselves more time) because of any postal and/or shipping delays. On Monday the 10th, they'll tell me to allow until the end of 14th. I wonder how long will I have to do this. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.

I've always been satisfied with their service, delivery and clothes that were provided. Turns out, that was only because I never encountered a problem. I placed an order on the 23rd of May. They promptly sent me an order confirmation, and took money out of my account the day after that. I never got a shipping confirmation, but since they stated the order will be here on the 31st, I didn't give it much thought. On the 30th of May, I spoke with their customer care (care as word here is used reaaaaally broadly), and basically they don't know anything, no connections to their warehouse, no knowledge about my order, it's like they don't even work for ASOS. All that they could do is, with obviously scripted words, „reassure“ me that my order is due on the 31st. Told me to wait, even though it seems ludicrous that the order will arrive on time, but fine, I can wait one more day. Well, Friday the 31st arrived and lo and behold, my order didn't arrive (which is obvious to everyone SINCE IT HADN'T SHIPPED). And now I get to repeat the whole process.Reached out to customer care again on the 31st, told me to get in touch on Monday, there's nothing they can do now. 

I am not dissatisfied just because of the order. I am completely dissatisfied with their treatment of the costumers and their absurdly incompetent way of training customer care employees. Obviously the people who work there aren't at fault here, they are just saying what they are told to, but it is so frustrating to even read what they type, it feels like I'm talking to a computer, but like the one from 1995. I don't want to be the 'you just lost a customer' person, but you definitely lost a customer.

I'm giving it two stars only because the products are good quality, and I never had any problem until now.",2,ASOS,1
Orsolya Biro,2019-07-31T21:20:02Z,Worst online shopping experience ever,"So here is my story (similar to several others who wrote a review here): I placed an order on 11th July, with expected delivery date by 22nd July. Today is 31st July and the order has not yet been shipped even. I wrote to customer service and they sent me an automated response saying I should check if order was delivered to neighbour, post office etc (this is for a package that has not even been shipped!), and that I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. I contacted them on the 5th day, but they said they would not follow up on my complaint before the END of the 5th day. So next day I contacted them again, and a few days later they responded, saying I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. This is outrageous! Are they really planning to send me an email every 5 days, asking me to wait for 5 days, until I give up and let them keep my money? I am now trying to get my money back through PayPal....
Update: today (1 Aug) ASOS cancelled and refunded my order.",2,ASOS,1

Overall payment and shipping is fine.

However, the ASOS design items I bought comes in poor quality.
Returned an espadrilles because stitching came loose and pending for refunds hopefully.
Washed and tried the denim shorts but the stitching works done in poor construction. Now I can’t return the jeans.

Out of 3 items, only 1 item I’m satisfied as done by other brand (Collusion). The collusion denim shorts was made well done.

Do consider before buying from Asos because their waiting time is very long to ship to Singapore as it’s from UK warehouse.",2,ASOS,1

The clothes selection is nice and that's why I go back HOWEVER, they probably have the worst customer service I ever had to deal with. The brand does not care at all about their customers satisfaction, helping you resolve issues, providing solutions. I just had a very annoying interaction with a customer service rep on the live chat, after providing no help and going back and forth for 50 mins, he closed the chat on me. Very frustrating.",2,ASOS,1
Sam C,2019-01-16T18:10:11Z,ASOS needs more transparency,"ASOS needs more transparency in their ordering process. They claim they offer tracking but all I get is a vague delivery estimate and a ""click here for live updates"" that leads to a page of general shipping information. It seems designed to dupe you and I feel like a fool for ordering from them not just once but twice. Especially since their website doesn't allow product reviews. I received the second order today and the product is nice, but I didn't expect to get dinged with an $18 customs fee when my order was <$70. Still waiting on the first order placed almost a month ago and scared of how much I'll have to pay on that. This website is probably worth the hype if you live in the UK or anywhere they cater to better than here. When it comes down to it, I could have spent the same amount at higher-end Canadian stores instead of trying to find deals online!",2,ASOS,1

This morning I woke up to another email from ASOS claiming that they had received my item and my refund would be processed over the next 10 working days. Confused, I contacted customer services using live chat. I explained the situation to which the customer service representative responded “your order has been refunded and you will receive payment on the 21st April.”Again, I explained that I had not even received the parcel. Instead of apologising the representative merely explained that the delivery driver may have not been able to locate my address, which is utterly ridiculous considering my office is in a large building in central London with a 24 hour reception desk. I asked if the representative could resend me the dress to which she informed me she could not and I would have to go back through the website to do this. What a complete shambles.

That first I need to return the product I've got and than within 45 working days (which practically is freaking 9 weeks or maybe more) they will repay me and I can order again what I want. I can't believe that a respectable (or I just thought it was) site like asos can say that especially when it's their fault. So I think I'm done with Asos at least for a year or so.

Amaani Al Amoudi,2019-06-20T06:59:57Z,Over 11years with Asos but recently dissapointed,"Been shopping with Asos since 2008 and can honestly say the quality of the items has gone down.
Not had any issues in regard to delivery, maybe some delayed returns but nothing major and I think having a premier account help.
However, the standard of the items being sent out are terrible. They're clearly sending out returns that are not up to the standard any customer would be happy with- tearing/ threads coming out, shoes obviously scuffed and look worn, no paper stuffing in the shoe (baring in mind I've ordered the same pair more than once to see if i have any lucky with the quality) and I've noticed recently when its ""low in stock"" depending what the item is- word of warning, expect to be sent a returned item that will likely already look worn /scuffed or stretched. Really disappointed with the standard of Asos recently. Your best bet is going for new full priced items on the website as the stock will be new/fresh- meaning theres less chance or being sent someone else's returns",2,ASOS,1

All they said was that I should choose next day delivery myself when I re-order at my expense. I further asked if they could give me a discount/promo code, or money back that I spent on delivery to be compensated for, however they refused.

His response was “you will have been sent an email, check your spam folder” which obviously I had done before getting in contact with them and so when I told him this he terminated the chat window so their customer service team do not deliver the best customer service and I know what good customer service is as I also work in retail so I think it was very poor that this has happened not once but twice to me.",2,ASOS,1

They advised to talk to you guys but your customer service rep advised that he doesn't have the answers at the moment. Your customer service rep was trying to contact FedEx  and advised to me that it will take 2 business days to get an answer back. I just called FedEx today and they gave me the answers I needed .  FedEx was great in getting the answer for me right away. I'm not sure why you guys need 2 business days to get a response from FedEx. It sounds like the business process is flawed when a customer can get an answer faster than a customer service rep.  I'm going to wait the 2 business days and see what the response is.

Asos the responsible retailer have kindly agreed to refund my shipping fee but wouldn't look into the case a whole week after my parcel was due! Their customer service is also very automated and relied upon macros, which makes things seem less empathetic and unfriendly. A little more of a personable response would be nice.

Beyond that, I will be taxed 7% goods and services tax. ASOS had sabotaged me by declaring the five items a whopping $471.01! That’s malicious and unethical. I didn’t buy that much nor paid remotely close to this figure. Jeez. But this was quickly resolved by me when I forwarded them the correct invoice. But guess what. Today, 21st of November, my item is still sailing the slow boat to me. The tracking just reflected that it’s been shipped. That’s two slap of my face. Over declaration and slow shipment. You guys and gals decide if this is worth the aggravation.",2,ASOS,2
Caroline Ly,2019-03-02T18:00:54Z,Crappy delivery system!,"I started buying from ASOS last year and I really liked their merchandise, so much that I signed up for one year of 2 day shipping for $19.99, which was an awesome price. Things went well for about 5 orders which were delivered in exactly 2 working days. I was a happy camper until my Feb 16, 2019 order. First I was told a delivery date of Feb 26, which is not 2 days. I asked and was told that the reason for the delay was that there has been a lot of businesses from the US. Not my fault! Then I get notified by Fedex of a delivery date of March 2. Two days later, it was changed to March 6, and the package has been shipped since Feb 26 from Georgia. What the heck!! Is Fedex taking the scenic route???? I enquired about this delay and was a given a generic answer, which means no help whatsoever! I don’t intend to buy anymore from ASOS.",2,ASOS,2
Katie Jennings,2018-11-16T13:29:59Z,ASOS keeping my money even though I don’t have the product,"I have shopped with ASOS for years now but whenever there is a problem they make it stressful to resolve the issue. I recently purchased a pair of shoes which they delivered in a bashed up bag with no box or return label. The shoes were tiny for a size 4 so I sent them back after going through the hassle of getting a new label from the Royal Mail. Due to my printer being broke this became difficult as I had to go to a particular post office to get a returns label (something ASOS should have provided) this has then resulted in the item getting lost in the returns process and asos happily keeping my money! I tried messaging the customer service team to resolve the issue, which they were very unhelpful!",2,ASOS,2

So they expect customers to just keep items with poor stitching or sizing that doesn't match their size guide? I still had some time left on my premier account but I decided to unsubscribe and never shop with them again. Disgusting way to run an online store.,2,ASOS,2

As a lot of people are shopping with asos more and more now. I ordered two items recently and they were meant to be a Christmas gift for someone. Once I received my order I saw that one of the items was not the item I originally ordered. It was completely different to what I had ordered, only similarities being the size and colour. I rang up the customer service and they assured me that they would arrange for me to receive the correct item. I also made sure to contact them by email so that they have proof in writing. In the email I clearly stated the item that was send to me and I clarified that this is not what I originally ordered. Two days passed and I received an email stating that my order is on its way, however once again it was the wrong item. At this point I was very frustrated and tired of calling their customer service. After speaking to them on the phone they realised the mistake and told me that the correct item will be send. I have my doubts... I do not understand how they can mess up my order to this extend when I made it very clear which item was send correctly and which one was not. Now it's been a week and I still have not received my item. At this time of the year making such mistakes is very frustrating for us customers because everyone knows the stress of getting presents sorted.

They’re a terrible company! Customer services handle most complaints very poorly. I recently returned an order as an exchange due to being sent the wrong size and instead of being sent the correct item I was refunded... despite the desired size being in stock. The loss of A-list is a major disappointment too, it was definitely something that had me coming back month after month. At this moment in time, they don’t really offer anything more than your average online retailer, if anything, it’s much less. I’ll be shopping elsewhere until they work harder to regain customer loyalty... and their delivery services.",2,ASOS,2

Now I'm three weeks in, contacted customer support again (praying I didn't get the same rude agent) and was told my order is lost in transit. 

So now half of the gifts didn't arrive, it's too close to Christmas to order them again (even though we've already exchanged gifts, thankfully I had time to get a few in the mean time) and now I'm not getting my order - which also had my Christmas Day outfit in it.",2,ASOS,3

I returned a couple of clothing as I was sent the wrong size including a leather jacket worth $260.
Apparently they never received the parcel which is ridiculous as this was all sent in one bag, they processed the less expensive items except 2 of the items that are over $200.
This did not make sense and I inquired about this and have proof of parcel delivered as it had to be signed by one of their staff. How can you process part of it and not the rest. According to them they never received it and when I showed them proof they got back to me and said it wasn't in the bag.
So what is it? you didn't get the parcel or it wasn't in the bag? I showed them photos of the bag as 2 of the items where bulky and the bag would be that big if those 2 items weren't in it.
Then just basically shut my account and i never heard from them as any e-mail sent will be blocked as they have stated in their last e-mail.

So many times this company has left the parcel in front of the door despite telling them to leave it in a safe place and so many times have parcels gone missing as a result of this when it comes to trying to deal with ASOS and getting a refund from them it often feels like pulling teeth and I have to use a alternative consumer conflict resolution company in order to get them to respond adequately because when you are launching a complaint different people  deal with the same complaint in the same department  so you often find yourself repeating yourself over and over again but the majority of the complaints stem from the delivery issues and they can fix this and become a good company if they news a company that has a lot more reliability and integrity,2,ASOS,3

Still not arrived 2 weeks later. Asos are very good at given their patter that they are looking into it and DHL are investigating. I have 8 reassuring generic emails that it is being looked into.What they are very stupid at not realising is that unless they rectify problems QUICKLY they will loose customers, not just me but younger generations that feel disgusted that a company acts like this. As a company that is  online and has no customer telephone number (which is ludicrous) I would be very cautious at ordering from them. My advise if you can get else where guaranteed delivery for a day go with that. I do not believe that they have a full process in place for order problems. I have worked as a Buyer in an international retail environment, and am fully aware problems happen. Remember Asos you only get remembered for bad experiences not good so these need to be dealt with to keep customer loyalty. As a retailer online no matter how good your stock is ASOS REMEMBER THERE IS NO ASOS WITHOUT CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY.  Please everyone preserve with any monies owed as I will and if no response I will be going through small claims court out of principle if not resolved.Update is they finally got back after about 3 weeks to say trainers were out of stock then waited another week for refund.

The customer service is literally worthless. I ordered a jumpsuit for my graduation to my old address by mistake, but luckily the local post initiated a ""return to sender"" OVER A MONTH AGO. Now I can understand delays within ASOS, but I don't see how that would affect the courier which operates completely independent of them. I have reached out at least four times about this order and NEVER get an answer beyond some scripted malarkey, like they never tell me anything that I don't already know. And actually I've had to tell THEM to track the package via the original number so they can see its on its way back to them. They are absolutely useless and inconsiderate. Any other company would acknowledge that I've waited long enough for an order I never even touched (there's proof of that in the tracking), and go ahead and issue the refund.

I lost hundreds of dollars this way.",2,ASOS,3

I’m a premier member so have unlimited next day delivery, however, I can’t remember the last time my next day delivery worked! I know this isn’t ASOS, however using DPD as a delivery firm is really not working. I was at home recovering from surgery, when I received my hour deliver slot from DPD, all of a sudden 1 minute past my delivery slot and I got a text to say no one was in. Absolutely ludicrous! And this isn’t the first time it’s happened. It’s just a shame now that I cannot rely on ASOS for prompt delivery and the service I have paid for. Gutted.",2,ASOS,4

Also I was charged for the these clothes the day after I made the order. I have been in contact with 3 members of staff at ASOS on live chat and the first 2 times they were no help at all! This is extremely frustrating and I have received nothing to compensate for this inconvenience. I had not had any problems with ASOS before and actually found them to be very convenient due to them having lots of brands in one place and a very wide range of products.,2,ASOS,4

It use to be that the camera was static and you got to see the garment in full with the model walking towards and away from the camera, like a full view catwalk.

But now they don’t keep the camera still or even show the whole garment in one shot. They’re trying to be edgy with camera play but it’s pointless and nauseating, and has put me off so bad that I now refuse to buy anything that doesn’t show a proper full view example, as I feel they’re trying to hide faults or less flattery features of the garment.

I ordered two jackets and boots and decided i didn’t like any of them and returned them. I sent the jacket out first via royal mail, and the boots and second jacket via Hermes a couple days later. My royal mail package had arrived at their depot a while ago but there was no confirmation of a refund, and by this time I had already recieved my Hermes refund. I decided to contact customer services via twitter (Do not contact them on ANY online platform as they will reply with the same automated message that they are ‘looking into it’) they were no help at all, I did the same with the live chat and spoke to around 4 different people and no one could tell me whats going on. I then found a number for asos and called them up and they told me theyd refer my issue to the specialist team and I would just have to send a picture of the proof of my royal mail receipt. Thankfully I still kept it! I was sceptical though, but I have just recieved an email from their team to confirm my refund of the jacket. It was a tiresome and long experience and I’m disappointed in them but glad I’ve got my £160 back. Next time I’ll definitely pay with paypal!",2,ASOS,4
Maria,2019-06-07T16:56:35Z,Poor delivery service,"My rating is related to the company that Asos partners up to deliver their packages here in NL. 
I think the issue is more in the shoulders of the company (PDP) but since Asos partners w them, I think it is only fair to share the blame. PDP has sent me bunch of delivery emails for my recent order w Asos, only to attempt to deliver at completely different date and time slot. Thankfully as I was keeping an eye on the delivery via track and trace, I was able to suggest change to deliver the order to a pick up location instead. They accepted this suggestion. I have left work early to pick up my parcel at this pick up location, only to get a message ( as I arrived) that they changed the delivery location to another location. Which was closing as I was receiving that message.
 I feel that the shipment market is absolutely in a need of innovation and some regulation as this is insane. They behave as if nothing mattered to them. We as customers have no say, nothing ever changes based on our feedback, because they are a necessary evil with low competition. Just so frustrating! Wish Asos offered variety of delivery companies options so that I did not have to repeatedly deal with DPD service.",2,ASOS,4

If you send it home and you can't  receive it when it arrives, good luck... I have has experiences with deliveries not arriving at all, arriving in unsafe locations or packages looking damaged. Yodel lets you 'choose' a safe location, but only from a dropdown menu, so it leaves very little room to play with if your safe place doesn't fit 6 or 7 options.

As soon as there is any issue which involves them investigating and putting right they become very unhelpful.  I ordered goods for next day delivery and the courier lied that they tried to deliver but that no one was in. I suspect they did this because they couldn't locate the doorway of the flat (being on top of shops). I contacted ASOS to ask them to give the courier directions but I was told they couldn't do that and that I should contact the couriers myself. I found this very unhelpful as I was not changing delivery address only giving extra directions. It's now the third day and the courier still has not showed up.

They were comfortable but very narrow around the toe area as if the shoes were an exact size eight. There was not one millimetre of room to even wriggle my toes. They do this every time with their own brand shoes and boots the sizing is very poor. I would have had to buy a size 8.5 or 9 for them to be a decent fit. The price they charge for their own brand shoes is not reflective of the poor fit and poorer quality of their footwear.

I emailed ASOS and they said I could send it back for a refund or exchange it for another one - so I sent it back and asked for another one (I even made a note on the slip to Explain who told me it was ok to do this) and apparently there was a ‘glitch’ in the warehouse system and they refunded me due to insufficient stock of the dress. I checked the website and this is still fully in stock.. I emailed and apparently there’s nothing they can do about it.

So, use Asos for ordering clothes but my suggestion is do never order ASOS brand clothes made in china with the cheapest materials you will regret it.

First of all I had to wait many days for receiving my item and after realising you have sent me an incorrect item, I had to contact you 4-5 times to get everything done.  For those cases you need to review your policy, if you actually care for customer satisfaction.  Now you are making the Customer spend time and money for ""fixing"" your fault.  The customer needs to place a new order, pay for it, create a new returns form, pay for it and go to the post-office to send you back the incorrect item and wait for approximately a month for receiving a refund.

Neema Hokes Bethune,2019-10-17T03:38:42Z,Customer service is of little service,"I love Asos and shop here from time to time. Most often I’m satisfied with the pricing, shipping and quality of items. If anything, it’s the lack of flexibility of the customer service reps that could use some work. 
I placed an order and immediately realized that I selected the wrong shipping address. Three minutes later I’m chatting with someone, great on the timing, but the response was that the address could not be changed once the order was placed. I would have to cancel and place it again. Only 1) I used a coupon code and didn’t want to take the chance that it wouldn’t work the second time around and 2) one of the items I purchased was the last in that size. I was afraid that it would take some time to update availability and I wouldn’t see the size as an option to placed in my cart. So ultimately the order will be sent to the wrong address and I’ll make a trip there to collect it. 

My other issue is that when you do use a coupon to buy something, if you need to exchange it for some reason, even for a reason outside of your control (e.g. wrong size was sent or item is defective), they will never give you a code, credit or option for exchange. You always have to return the item and repurchase it at the current website pricing. If I saved $10 on a dress the first time I bought it, I don’t want to lose that discount because you sent me the wrong size. It’s disappointing that they have zero flexibility and always give you a canned response. For instance, I had a coupon when I purchased the dress I received today. Only I ordered a medium and in the bag was a small. Now all I can do is return and place a brand new order sans coupon. Not great.",3,ASOS,1

Asos has good prices, student discounts,  virtual catwalk to see how clothes fit, a wide product range and customer support are always nice to you. 

However, something that often happens is that the delivery is wrong and even if the staff are nice and wants to help, it feels like there is a lack of communication between customer service and other branches like purchasing, stock etc.

The matter is often sent around between different people within the company and usually to the level that someone forgets to answer so you do not hear back from them and you'll have to contact them again.

Most of the time I'm missing items or a package is missing which get really frustrating when it happens too often.

Cyril Bordat,2019-10-16T03:04:20Z,Payment issue with the android app,"hi

using the app for the second time (first time went well), and paying through paypal i had a bad behavior with the app, charging my paypal but not sending the order through.

I been told by the support i will have my money back in 48 hours ( we will see about that, cannot confirm yet). Assuming the bug would be fixed the day after i tried again and the same issue occurred.

i'm surprised by how slow the company is to react to such issues, with all the competition on the market you want your client to be confident when paying through an app, and now i became skeptical about it.

it worked well with the web platform though.(just ordered tonight using paypal).

Working in software engineering i would take several actions with my PO and address with the dev team  rapidly how to face such issues for the clients.

I understand you want to get paid before the order goes through, but  you should validate if the order is successfully sent before charging paypal and not the other way around. (i find that approach creepy), and if the order is not sent through don't allow the payment (something like  that).

Anyhow, that's why i'm rating 3 stars my experience, although i think we should have Orders in the main menu and not under My account, beside that i love the dark theme, the videos for the items and the app in its globality.

thank you for reading me.

Jake,2019-10-08T01:16:27Z,"Missing item, wrong size","Please note that this is a review for my experience and not for the customer service member I spoke with.

I ordered 5 items and only 4 arrive.  Of those 4, 1 item was the wrong size.  After speaking with my CSR Narina, I found that the shoes (1307188) are listed on the website as US half-sizes (I ordered 10.5), while the actual shoe is made in UK whole sizes (I received a 10).
Obviously the shoe didn't fit and now I have to return it for a refund.  It also looks like the size I would need is out of stock, so I won't be able to wear the shoe at all.

Remains to be seen what happens with the missing item.  Given that the bag arrived open it's likely not the fault of ASOS, but hopefully I can get my item before the event I purchased it for.

So far, a pretty lousy experience for me.

Anyway, I went to customer service right away and they weren’t helpful at all. They had no way of tracking my package and couldn’t even tell me when it had left the UK. They basically just extended the delivery time and told me to contact them if I still hadn’t received my items after that date. I was very short with the rep and feel a bit bad about it now because the package did actually show up within a week after contacting them.

The query I contacted the online Customer Service with was solved politely and efficiently, though it took quite a long time. 

The main problem was that I went to pick up the shipment to discover they had shipped all the items in one huge box, without e.g. handles. Had the post office not loaned me a hand truck, it would've been impossible to get it home. They should consider dividing larger shipments. Also all the packages should definitely have handles/string/rope attached, so that they can be carried.

You also have to print the returns label yourself - it's obviously a big problem if you don't own a printer. They should include the label with your package. Failing that, you should be able to e.g. write the return details on the package.",3,ASOS,2

I couldn't alter delivery address even though they'd not yet prepared the package. I could order again and send the original package back upon arrival but it had gone up in price and they wouldn't honour the original price paid.Bit of a shame as I assumed asos would be more like amazon in that they clearly value the customer over everything, even if they take a bit of a hit but sadly not.",3,ASOS,2

I contacted Asos via live chat, the representative fobbed me off and told me I needed to “wait and see” if it delivered, even though I assured her three times that DPD hadn’t even received the parcel and so it was impossible for it to be delivered. I asked her to contact the Asos warehouse to see if there was any update and to avoid any further delays. She refused and said I had to wait until the end of the day.

ASOS customer service never seem to understand my issue when I contact them about delivery problems or queries or get the urgency. 

I used to have their Premium Delivery which gave me free NDD which was great but now the price has increased and I feel like the service received has gone downhill.

There have been many occasions where I have paid for next day delivery and it has not come next day, I tend to think often this is normal. On the other hand as it happened recently, it had led me to think...what service am I actually paying for if it doesn't arrive next day? After being in touch with their customer service team several times, it seems that they are too blasé to actually want to help their customers. No sense of urgency, no sense of compassion and not a thought of compensation.

The attitude many Asos workers seem to bring really make me want to reduce the business I conduct with them, which is an awful pity.",3,ASOS,2
JD,2018-12-03T17:25:33Z,No order confirmation email or order number generated but my credit card was still charged,"I placed my first ever order to ASOS for a pair of boots for my daughter. After completing the order, I realized a few days later I'd never received an email confirmation. Meanwhile my credit card was charged and posted for the total amount.  I got nowhere with two ASOS online chat help sessions. I was finally told my credit card had been denied and my order canceled, and I would receive credit in 10 business days. However, they were not able to explain to me how the credit card charge was posted and cleared if it was ""denied."" Based on my experience, I am NOT waiting for this ""refund"", as they claim no order even exists! I have initiated a dispute with my credit card. Meanwhile, the item is now out of stock, and I was unable to order it since they no longer had my daughter's size.  Oddly, I was texting my daughter about this whole thing while it was going on, and she went online (she is in another state) and ASOS showed availability in the boot in her size. What!?!  And no, it wasn't her cart that had taken what I wanted.  My end showed no availability before, during and after hers did. So I had her order it, but I don't trust that she will get them until I actually see them!  I will never order from them again.  UPDATE: I am upgrading my review to 3 stars (from 1 originally) because a very pleasant higher level customer service person called me today and she was finally able to tell me what had happened with my order. It turns out that my order did ship, and that the two agents with whom I'd previously chatted online had given me incorrect information. I am supposed to receive the boots in about a week, and I have since canceled my dispute with my credit card.  Because ASOS finally got it straightened out and gave me a discount code for my next purchase as a way of acknowledgment and apology, I give them an upgrade for getting to the bottom of it. Of course now I will have to return one pair but at least return shipping is free.",3,ASOS,2

I attempted to contact Asos only finding ""live Chat"" so I spoke to a member of their team who just stated there has been a problem with the delivery company and it will arrive in two days time, she said she will update the tracking and I will receive an email stating this change, this I didn't receive (also checking my Junk folders) .
Another week passed of waiting (as well as the event) so I decided I wanted to cancel the order, as I had purchased an alternative dress from another company, so I spoke to another member of their team via live chat and asked if it was possible to cancel the order as the event the dress was required for had passed, he stated: He understands and has passed it onto a specialist team that will contact me within 72 hours. I then received an email two days later saying they've refunded  the amount and it will appear 5-10days in my bank, it arrived the next day so I cannot fault them for this as its their chosen delivery company that are at fault.

I paid extra for a shorter delivery and my delivery information stated my order would arrive in two days (a Saturday) which was great as I needed the products by Sunday to showcase them to the bride of the wedding I am part of. However, when tracking my delivery despite the ASOS tracking saying Saturday, Yodel tracking said Monday. Obviously, the parcel was not delivered Saturday. On Monday whilst out, I received a message from Yodel saying my delivery was left in a 'safe' place, but when I arrived home it was left in plain site at my front door.

Generally, I'm very happy with my orders, although finding stuff that I like can be difficult. A lot of clothes are so close to being really nice but there's always something a little off. It could be anything from extra ruffles or weird colours to a strange cut. Despite this I always find myself coming back to see what's new and I generally find their simpler clothes to be quite nice.

I also primarily get my jeans from here although this can also be a bit dicey. I regularly order the Curve Ridley Jeans and I recently ordered 2 pairs - one dark blue wash and one a 'nanette darkwash', the dark blue wash fitted as normal but the nanette darkwash was very loose. They were the exact same style and size of jean but there was such disparity in how they fit, it was very strange. But I kept both and use the latter when I want a very casual outfit.

If I could, I would give ASOS 3.5 stars, they're not quite at 4 or 5 stars given the outlined issues above.",3,ASOS,3

This time something is really wrong. The items have not even left the warehouse. There is no tracking number, and on the courier site it shows that for 3 days they are scanning the items. :-(. 
Contacted costumer service yesterday and they just told me they are sorry and that my order should arrive by tomorrow (it is still in the warehouse). Do miracles happen? Asos should really think of changing their delivery company.

EDIT: So I changed my first review from one to three stars, as my order actuallly arrived with one day delay. The problem was there was no email notification regarding the dispatch of the delivery and no tracking number.",3,ASOS,4

Cari,2019-11-26T15:23:53Z,I've used asos since 2006,"I've used asos for many years and will keep using.

Only problem ive ever had was a mistake order to an old default address. Asos refused to cancel or change the address. They were absolutely unhelpful and told me to intercept the £300+ parcel at the door of a students flat. And pretty much, you're on your own! Not their problem. Even though it was the most straightforward thing to change the address. That was it. It hadnt been dispatched. They refused to cancel the order even though it took them a further 3 - 5 days to dispatch and it had not been packed. It was beyond frustrating, I kept asking them to cancel and it was going round in circles being fobbed off and told to wait until the courier gets my parcel and then the students at the address can return to sender (as if a struggling student is likely to return a parcel they received! They'd simply keep it and it was so much stress explaining this to Asos and for them to palm me off and to tell me they were sending it anyway, and can you sort it out? It hasn't been dispatched or packaged yet but we have a policy to send it our regardless. 
This is a really dumb policy and must cause chaos for your poor buyers

I dont drive and it would of cost me a further £70 a taxi! 

I messaged Asos yet again on day 5 explaining the problem and that i was about to lose over £300 quid and as requested to get back in touch so they can message the courier and have it returned.


They said we will message the courier, and to message them again if i dont hear back confirmation and they might be able to get the parcel returned to sender. In the end i contacted the Yodel courier myself explaining the mess - and Asos refusing the whole time to cancel the order or the incorrect address and they were given plenty of notice from myself.


The parcel was returned to sender without i understand being handed to strangers at a student flat.

But it was one of the most stressful experiences ever. Asos needs to sort out this policy they have! 

Apart from this
They dispatch in a decent time frame, pretty straightforward and dont sell items out of stock its more bam its yours - and on its way to you


I used Asos since i was 16 so since 2006. Its been OK generally. The clothes are great and true to size!",3,ASOS,5

Jules Grygiel,2019-07-27T09:15:11Z,ASOS is not what it used to be,"ASOS is not what it used to be, this does not concern their stock, that’s still excellent, a huge variety of labels and you will always find what you’re looking for. 
Their service however has drastically changed and I could just about ignore their decline because they’re one of the only companies that still send a printed return label in their orders! But once your order is placed you receive no tracking, recently it came through 10 days after I had taken delivery! But most recently I received an email from them saying that recently I had returned a ‘higher than average’ amount of orders and whilst they weren’t about to act on this they wanted to let me know that their has been a high amount of customers that have been ‘abusing’ their service and items returned were not in their original condition etc that they had located a specific number of these abusers and closed their accounts, not to worry, they weren’t doing that with mine, 
What am I meant to think about this? I am a 47 yr old woman who will order a few things (always in the sale) for choice and return them if they don’t suit me or THEY HAVE CLEARLY BEEN WORN BEFORE!!! three days after I received this email I received an order I had placed of bra’s, it’s hard to find a bra that fits well, so I was pleased to find that both bras fitted, however one of these bras ( a Gossard ) had absolutely been worn, it stank to high heaven of B.O and their were underarm stains when I looked closer,whilst trying it on I just began to smell this horrific B.o smell so it wasn’t like it was unnoticeable, well someone re-packed it and thought it was good enough to send out!! 
The thing is, I kept the bra, despite it’s condition, because it was on sale, Gossard is a good make and it fit me!! That’s hard to find and I knew if I sent it back and asked for a replacement it would be out of stock because it was on sale,
I’m not an abuser of ASOS or any other online clothes store, I have been however a victim of it on more than one occasion with ASOS but do you think I’m going to return something in the future and say I think it’s been worn? Absolutely not, because after their email to me it’s going to seem like I am guilty if I do, so therefore I close my own account with ASOS. Because I was so offended by their email, clearly pointing the finger in my direction that I no longer want to shop with them.",3,ASOS,5

ASOS just can't seem to get it right. Many of these clothes is very similar to to cheap ones at wish, and I often wonder ''who wears this??'', and ''who CAN wear this?'' it's often very poorly sewn, and not washable, like I said, there's just always something that's off, it's the common saying of ''You get what you pay for''.

However in recent months this has changed and ASOS no longer inform the customer that either the return has been received, or a refund authorised.  I now have to check my proof of postage to see when it was received by ASOS and then send an email to customer service with the order number and request confirmation of refund.  This lessens the quality of the shopping experience and is annoying.  I am much less likely to now recommend ASOS shopping to friends.",3,ASOS,9

I've spoken with two ASOS agents today. Both were courteous, understanding, knowledgable and tried their best to assist me as much as they could. 

However, they can't do much in their capacity to solve more complex issues like the one I have and as basically the ONLY point of contact, they should be able to do things like tell me exactly where my package is or at least point me in the right direction. ""It's with FedEx"" isn't enough information when you're racing against the clock to have an issue sorted out. 

Nevertheless, great customer service.",4,ASOS,1
Yasha,2019-12-20T14:20:05Z,Dimensions puzzle,"I've got a trousers of the size where the dimension that played a role was Hips, not Waist. That changed everything and I could not understand how what I received fits reality at all. I've figuratively got an elephant instead of a fly: not a mistake of half a size you normally do. After some very inappropriate cliched explanations, service operator Rebecca has provided, I succeeded to explain her the case and she changed her modus operandi. One and a half hour later we've got if not the final solution, but at least an explanation of what happened and some plan for me what to do now. 

For the site I would suggest to mention near this specific item, that it does not sit on waist and hips do only matter.",4,ASOS,1

The package contained gifts for family and i was not able to find a replacement gift in time for Christmas. 

Also, the purchases came with the 25% discount for black friday and given that the refund was made, that means i couldnt purchase the items again at the same price. Not the biggest issue but would have been better if i was informed earlier of the inability to deliver the package. The status on the Asos site consistently showed that the package was in the process of being delivered.

According delivery, i did not relieved my parcel, it was my first parcel and maybe last. If we check my rating in Aliexpress its more than 800, and we can compare my Address, both address will be same.

The only thing I was disappointed with (but not to the fault of ASOS) was the customs I had to pay and the fact that it was delayed for 6 weeks because my package was randomly selected at customs to be charged. So I paid $370 for my dress, but had to pay $137 on customs when it arrived. I’ve applied to Canadian customs to get my money back since I returned the dress. Hopefully I get it back. But this is just a reminder about possible additional fees when you purchase a dress... and possible delays.

Celia Coles,2019-12-05T14:17:08Z,"Dealt with x2 people, Alison really good, Elise, AWFUL.","I spoke with two people. First person was called Elise, and the second Alison. The reason why I've rated highly was because of Alison. Alison was super helpful and amazing. I ordered my items on Cyber Monday with the premier delivery which I needed for Friday, obviously I know it might take longer than a couple of days so I patiently waited. It is now Thursday and DPD have said that my items are being sent back to ASOS and I just wanted to know why. One item size was out of stock of the size I chose and are now out of sale but Alison managed to honor the sale prices to me, which was extremely kind. 5* for Alison.

Elise, however, was extremely unhelpful, rude and just closed the chat when I asked why my order had been sent back. I wasn't being rude, she just wasn't giving me any answers which Alison managed to give me. She also told me the only way I can get my items are to reorder with the out of sale prices...? Why on earth would I do that when this whole thing has been completely out of my power? She said she wasn't able to do anything about it, to just ""reorder my items if I want them"" and then just shut the conversation. All I wanted was to know why my items were being sent back. I'm a loyal customer of ASOS, and to be spoken to and treated like that is totally unacceptable. Thankfully Alison managed to make it a lot better for me.

-5* for you, Elise.",4,ASOS,1

Andrew,2019-11-19T21:19:35Z,3rd Re-order,"Took a little while to connect but the issue was addressed and hopefully resolved. After ordering something that was in stock twice, it was unsuccessful each time. I spoke with a rep named Callum, he verified the item was in stock and said to try it through the desktop browser. Hopefully that works out.

The first two times I tried paying via Klarna. I noticed that the 3rd time there was a price change, the item was now listed under $50.  With Klarna you can only make purchases with items over $50. Wondering if maybe that price change caused some kind of glitch & had something to do with the item not going through the first two times. Or if, in fact, it did have something to do with the iPhone app.

Anyway, appreciate the help.  Hope my order goes through, I really want that jacket!

They also never tried to phone. I was using the tracker online and the status was that it would be delivered the next day - which it wan't.

Rachel Brotman,2019-11-18T19:45:18Z,Lianne was very helpful,"Lianne was very helpful, but another Customer Service rep is the reason I will never shop at ASOS again.

I reached out because I did not receive an order confirmation email but the order was processed and posted on my credit card statement. When I initially reached out, the first representative I spoke to named Grant, told me the order had never been processed because my card declined the payment. I told him I was looking at my card statement and was seeing it as having been processed and posted. He told me I would need to reach out to American Express and take it up with them and disconnected the chat before I would share confirmation from Amex that I had been charged the close to $200 for the order. 

I connected to another rep, Lianne and she was far more helpful. I explained the situation, shared the Amex provided statement with her and she actually asked for some additional info including my address, full name and birthdate. She then escalated to the correct team that can further assist me.

Aiden Symons,2019-10-05T09:34:18Z,"ASOS great, courier companies not so much",I would give 5 stars as ASOS are always incredibly helpful and any issues you do have are which are rare are dealt with. Unfortunately courier companies like Hermes let ASOS down as they really are terrible and I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the customer service ASOS staff deal with  are a result of Hermes poor service.,4,ASOS,1

The advisor was helpful and quick to respond.

I think ASOS should offer to take action against the courier sooner than 5 days / full working week of delays. I pay for next day delivery so for the courier to delay delivery 5 days in a row without consequence is unreasonable in my opinion.",4,ASOS,1

I purchased a pair of jeans. Overall, I love the jeans. They’re good quality and look like the picture. They fit perfectly as well (I used their fit guide quiz). My only complaint was that they look slightly different on me than the model, but that could be boiled down to height and body type. My order was estimated to arrive by April 3rd, and it actually came early on March 30th, which I was quite happy with because most people seem to be complaining about shipping. I did not pay the extra price for the express shipping, because in my experience, items never seem to arrive earlier, no matter the company.",4,ASOS,1

First it said it is going to be here on 23th of May, then on 3rd of June, then on 6th of June,  then it said 17th of june. Seeing them prolong delivery time has been stressfull, but dresses have arrived today (5th of June). So its great, cause my ocassion that I bought them for is tomorow. I contacted customer service via live chat on Web site, they were nice but they said they cannot do anything, maybe they did. Dresses are great, I like the quality, they are Asos brand. Only thing is that, I bought size 38 expecting to alter dresses, and I even lost some weight and they are almost too small. So go size up if u are buying non lace dress.",4,ASOS,1

If it wont be solve i have no choice but to quit use your site and guide all my friend that joined to do the same...
And publish the mails and talks we had that others will know how committed your site to coustmers.
Un acceptable treatment... 
This is not the way you act to people you could have done many things to fix it but you choose to stand on your Backfeet and tell the same mantra: ""package damaged... You can reorder"".
Do as u wish you are the system here .

She didn't brush the issue off as my fault and looked into things properly and took the appropriate action. I would have given 5 stars if the issue could have been sorted straight away, but this is not the fault of the staff, probably more a process within the company.

I contacted their customer service to ask to send someone over only to hear a clear lie why it wasn't completed they offered they will forward my complaint to another Hermes team who would contact me within 48 hours and 'try' to help me (!!) Why wouldn't you just send somebody over to pick up? Especially when you clearly made a mistake? I ended up walking half an hour to a nearest post office to get it returned on time. Shocking approach from Hermes let ASOS and me down.

However, ASOS has really impressed me by how it responded to my issue. My parcel arrived empty on Sunday and by Tuesday they had already replaced my lost item with another one. My husband's birthday surprise was ruined, however I was not expecting them to act so quickly and sort my issue out within 48 hours. I had lost all faith in online shopping and was utterly devastated but I must say their customer care towards my issue has been very reassuring. My husband now has his watch and I am sooo relieved...On the other hand a token of apology for the inconvenience would have sorted this for good...anyhow I'm just glad I did not lose my money forever.

This is really great because the photos don`t always show the material, fitting, and the model of the thing. In addition, under each product, there is a dimensional table of a specific brand and specific things. Choosing on them, the chance to settle with the size will be minimal.

So basically delivery must have come to the UPS access point, from which I would take my clothing. When I have checked where is my order, it was written that it is being returned to the ASOS! I was highly frustrated and disappointed and decided to in deep and analyze why it wasn't delivered and basically it was written that UPS station refused to take my order! I was shocked. Was calling UPS, no answer. Reached to the ASOS support, and they told me that my order is going to be refunded in 10 days...... I simply lost control, as I am leaving in 9days from the UK and needed this clothing urgently.

I am very disappointed that I should order this clothing again, but at first wait for a refund, then try to catch my size in stock and then again wait for the order to come. NICE :)",4,ASOS,3

alex,2019-07-02T21:23:22Z,Great clothes and easy refunds,"I did 3 recent orders with Asos and had no problems at all. I ordered through Klarna , which is perhaps why my refund was received quickly and transferred smoothly. The parcels did arrive on the due date ( standard delivery ), however I did do one next day delivery which I paid £5.95 for , but did not receive the next day. I emailed their customer service and they replied quickly, saying that I had ordered after 12pm so therefore it would come two days later, not one. This was fine for me, but the website had told me if I paid for next day, I would receive it the next day, so  it would have been a lot more useful if they actually made this delivery date estimate  more accurate. I did email them back asking if I could have my next day delivery fee refunded as it didn’t come the next day and this could have been very inconvenient for me however I was told it wasn’t possible.
Overall, ASOS has a great range of products and uses partially recycled delivery packaging ( a bonus !) , their customer service was good, however I would have liked more details on the next day delivery as I had paid it all for nothing !",4,ASOS,3
Angela,2019-06-29T15:31:45Z,So here's the thing with Asos,"So here's the thing with Asos. 

Clothes may not look the same as they did online and quality might not be as good as expected when you buy the cheapest brands they offer. You may get lucky though and get some cheap nice stuff, it's not all bad quality in my experience. They do offer other quality brands you can buy albeit for a higher price point. You get what you pay for, and a 5 quid jumper is not going to be great and not a reason to moan online.

Shipping is quick and returns are easy. You can use the same packaging they used to send your stuff, it comes with a slip you can fill in and you only need to drop it off at the post office. Once they receive your return, they'll refund you pretty quick. This has happened to me a few times and I've never had any issues with it. 

However, if you try to get any customer service from them it's only going to make things difficult for you. It's slow and useless, so don't even try. If you have any issues just return the item for a refund, if you need a smaller size just buy a new one and return the other one. The returns process is so easy that it's not worth getting worked up over their customer service.",4,ASOS,3

Elizabeth D.,2019-12-29T02:47:05Z,ASOS has great products but almost non-existent customer service,"If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have given ASOS a 5/5 but recently I had a lot of issues with customer service and returns. My family and I were going on vacation and I ordered swimsuits for my brother and father and then sunglasses and accessories for myself. I got express shipping which said it would be delivered in two business days (I was ordering on a Wednesday morning and it estimated Friday as the delivery – we were leaving for our trip on Saturday). 

I placed the order but when I got the confirmation, it had Monday as the delivery date. I spent over 30 minutes chatting with customer service and they said there was nothing I could do as that was the fastest shipping speed. They would not let me cancel the order since you only get 15 minutes to cancel yet they had me chatting in the customer service chatroom for 30+ minutes and only told me this at the end of our conversation. They then told me I could just return the whole package, which I agreed to. I then went back online and re-ordered EVERYTHING and got one-day shipping (the most expensive option). Come Friday, I get BOTH the one-day and the express orders, so I ordered double for no reason and the customer service lied when they said Monday was the soonest they could ship these items. It was very disappointing. 

Now that all being said, the quality of ASOS products is usually amazing (their size chart is a bit off though, so make sure to carefully read the sizing for each item). Their return policy is also very nice and the fact it is free is great too. I regularly use ASOS and I really like their clothing, size range, and accessories, but they need better customer service and more effective communication.",4,ASOS,4

K7,2019-09-04T10:56:59Z,Recently gone downhill,"ASOS are ok if you're looking for specific items such as branded clothing- they normally have sales and discounts. The website is easy to navigate and easy to favourite items to look at again. 

Delivery and returns are simple. It makes you feel at ease if you can return something you are unsure of hassle free. I'd advise if you're a frequent shopper to buy 1 year's next day delivery- it pays for itself.  

Avoid buying ASOS branded products. They are generally poor quality. 

They issue discounts on your birthday and for holidays such as Black Friday and Bank Holidays so if you're not desperate, wait for a discount code.

Recently, I've had to contact ASOS for a couple of orders. I got sent the wrong item and used my next day delivery as I needed them the next day. Had to send them back and told someone on the customer chat that I had been sent the wrong item and it was a complete waste of my time- they didn't even apologise for the mistake. He also said he'd refund the next day delivery- but never did. The other order I sent a pair of shoes back to request another size, I got an email nearly a week later saying I was being refunded even though I checked the website and the size was available. I had used a bankhol code and explained I couldn't reorder the item as the team member was suggesting as I wouldn't get a discount. They very kindly said they'd send me a new code- so I guess we'll see if that comes through.

The only other downside is how long it takes to process returns or exchanges. And if you've bought next day delivery for the year- it doesn't work on exchanged items so its best to return the item and reorder (if you haven't used a discount code)

The fact I was told I would be issued another code has redeemed my review to 4 stars- that may change.",4,ASOS,4

Then I received an email.. it was kind of like a warning about returning too many items and basically I felt uncomfortable after reading it.. my initial thoughts were, oh no.. I’m afraid to buy anything off them again now.. i’ll Feel pressured to keep it and not return it etc.  Just now I have read reviews from others who have had accounts cancelled for doing exactly what I have done.. so while my experience before that email and reading the reviews would have definitely earned them 5 stars without a doubt..

I had bought a RI bag from them and after 6 months of owning it, the item had begun to wear away. I contacted asos and they issued me with a full refund. Only once asos had sent me two different sizes shoes, but luckily I was able to get an exchange. Next day deliveries always arrive. I have the same amazing delivery people each time from DPD and Hermes. My returns have always arrived and been either exchanged or refunded using collectplus tracking. The only thing I will say is that refunds do take some time after the parcel has been returned. But that’s to be expected. I received a damaged eyeshadow palette along with a brand new one so now I have two minus a yellow shade. I had bought a acne light thingy by Foreo for my cousin that didn’t work for her. After a week she sent it back and I got my refund. Asos customer service, in my opinion, has been good to me and I will continue to shop with them as they DO! care about their customers.",4,ASOS,4

Ciara Emery,2019-06-24T11:02:32Z,Old faithful with room for improvement,"ive been using ASOS since 2010 and i can honestly say its been a bit of a lifesaver when it comes to online shopping. But it does have its cons as well!

Pros
The product selection grows from year to year and I know that when the high street lets me down I can always rely on ASOS to deliver something i like!

premier delivery - £9.99 for a year is worth every penny, over 9 years i have only ever had a small hand full of delivery issues and i think it might be due to me using premier delivery - guaranteed next day delivery and an easy returns process (as far as ticking a box and sticking a return label on the front!) my area delivers Asos via DPD which i don't really get many problems with.

a mixture of own brand and high street products - well why pay for delivery on that item I want from river island or new look if they have it on ASOS and you get free delivery?

Cons
Sizing and sells outs - considering how big asos are I do think they need to up their game when it comes to getting accurate sizing details and replenishment of sell-out items - as a customer there is nothing worse than finding something you love... then seeing its only available in a UK size 4...

customer service - over the past 9 years the customer service has definitely taken a turn for the worst. Response times are not great and then the physical responses are so scripted it defeats the point in trying to contact them....

delivery - when i do on occasion have a delivery issue (mainly with Hermes!) ASOS are not at all helpful and state the issue lies with the courier (which it does 9 times out of 10) but i feel that asos should take on a bit more responsibility - especially when you look through these reviews and can see that the vast majority are due to delivery or logistic issues",4,ASOS,4

I think the problem lied where some products were actually cheap quality and it wasn't really apparent then possibly price.

For many items i had to do my own research which is annoying especially it takes my eyes off their site. Hope they keep improving and deliver great style.

Member since early 2000s.,2019-10-13T02:33:46Z,I buy from ASOS (Canada) with confidence.,"ASOS.com (Canada) is probably the single-best retailer web site I have ever encountered.  Usability, searchability, transparency...they are unmatched in the online retail world.  Users can easily find fabric content, plus most clothing and shoes include a video of the item being modelled, along with the model’s height and size.

Shipping is pretty good.  For example, although standard shipping was free, I paid $20 for expedited shipping on my most recent order.  I placed the order October 01, and received it October 03 (UK to Toronto). 

As a Canadian, my experience has been that ASOS orders elicit the maximum in customs, duty, and tax fees to be paid upon delivery, and are never exempt.  (Additional fees up to 50% of the order total should be expected.) 

Unfortunately, the 2 pairs of men’s shoes in my recent order, were not standard sizing.  Thus, I had to submit my first ASOS return.  That was as straightforward and transparent as the purchase process.  

ASOS has a system in place to allow the purchase of a flat-rate return label, which routed my package to a local company who, then, handled the return back to ASOS in the UK.  

I mailed my return package on October 04, and received an email from Canada Post on October 05, indicating receipt of my return parcel.  I just received a notice from ASOS, October 12, letting me know they’ve submitted a refund for the full amount of my order.  

Everything has been very professional and transparent.  I appreciate that.  

I buy from ASOS (Canada) with confidence.",4,ASOS,13
Lagan,2019-07-23T12:20:30Z,I love Asos and their clothes,"I love Asos and their clothes. The bad thing is their return policy with 28 days which is an odd and uneven number so it's hard to know the exact last day you have to return your clothes if you want your money back. There is no information on their website about it, other websites for example Zalando write which day you have to send back your order if you want your money back, but Asos doesn't have that service. I had to contact their customer service about this but it took weeks for them to reply, which is not ok! I eventually did send back clothes from the same order before the last return-date, but then recieved an email where Asos said that I returned the clothes too late - even though it was their customer service that told me that exact date! A bit confusing and strange, but they wrote in the email that they made an exception and will return my money this time. But this doesn't feel so safe for me as a customer.

Also you have to print out your return labels. Seems a bit old, who owns a printer nowadays? I had to print out the labels from an internet shop for €7, there goes the free return. I also spent hours looking for a place with printers. 

I really love the clothes <3 but Asos need to update their return policy and become more modern.",4,ASOS,13

Sadly the warehouse tends to overpack bags on large orders, and not fulfil orders correctly, with incorrect items, or not packing at all.",4,ASOS,16
Tasfia Corja,2019-01-25T15:15:23Z,"Fast delivery, free returns, pay before buying.","It is actually pretty great.

There's little to go wrong. The courier once delivered my parcel to someone else without trying to deliver to me first even though I was at home he didn't bother ringing the bell, but that's just Hermes being... Well, Hermes.

Customer service at Asos is not so polite as other places, I found some customer service representatives via chat being less than patient and get irritated rather quickly. Nevertheless of course they still tried to help.

I never once had to call this company but I found it annoying how they made it so hard to just email them without going through the stupid online form, honestly. Provide all your details as a company and us customers won't be so dramatic!

In terms of delivery they are super quick it's amazing and returns as well they are amazingly fast. Using Klarna with this company is the cherry on cake!! Can't-stop-shopping!!",4,ASOS,16

WayWay,2018-11-04T11:02:23Z,I am new to ASOS and read reviews here…,"I am new to ASOS and read reviews here before buying. I found the website easy to navigate maybe helped by knowing exactly what I wanted. As I had a discount code I was expecting an issue ( these codes either work or not and, if the latter, it is usually presumed that the customer is at fault. Rarely will the retailer admit to/accept the fault being theirs. But that’s another issue). WOW! The discount code was accepted and the ease of placing the order & paying raised a smile on my face. I got updates and the goods were received CAREFULLY & WELL PACKAGED and in pristine condition. The order price was competitive so that influenced my purchase. I like a good deal! My reason for 4 stars being that delivery was slower than competitors standard /free delivery, and the amount of card & paper in the parcel was unnecessary and expensively produced. Would be better to save money using a ‘print if needed’ returns system and use savings to improve other areas or offer more customer discounts or plant a tree ( if you don’t do that already). Just a suggestion from an average customer 🤔 I will buy again.",4,ASOS,21

Alexis,2020-01-03T12:02:29Z,The quality is magnificent,"I ordered 3 dresses. Delivery was prompt (took only 4 days and there was bank holiday in a meantime). Dresses are really pretty, I can tell it’s much better quality than New Look which has been my favourite store where I buy size 12 from. I thought sizing would be the same at Asos, but I wasn’t even able to try size 12 dresses on! I don’t think size 14 would make much difference, 16 would be probably still a bit tight in bust so... am I size 18 in one store and 12 in another, or was that just bad luck with types of dresses I got?
I was really looking forward to get my order, but I will have to return all of this. Sizes 14-16 are not available anymore, so I feel a bit disappointed. However the quality of these dresses is amazing (all are lace and it’s nice thick material) and so much better I’ve seen in other stores.
I hope return process will go smoothly and if that’s the case, I will definitely go back. Lesson learnt - I will get bigger sizes in the future.
And start a diet.",4,ASOS,37

Typical Hermes problems of them leaving parcels anywhere and incorrect updates/tracking.

When I got in contact with ASOS their system showed that Hermes had delivered it to their own designated safe space - a staircase that several people use throughout the day - so, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what had actually happened.

I've had similar happen a couple of times before and ASOS were a nightmare in resolving it, so I stopped shopping with them as they treated me like a criminal. Luckily, Joseph saw that I don't have a history pretending things are missing to get free clothes and quickly arranged a refunded.

I get that ASOS deal with a lot of scammers and have had to change their policies because of it, but it's not fair to treat all customers like that when you've done nothing wrong so I appreciated a different approach from Joseph compared to previous experiences.",5,ASOS,1

The length of these trousers are usually too long and I oftrn have to send them back . I hope ASOS will consider putting the length of the pants or trousers so that even though it is the right  size, we would not attempt to buy if the length is longer than 32 inches.",5,ASOS,1

Robin A. Lewis,2019-12-11T17:25:50Z,ASOS should stand for All-Stars of…,"ASOS should stand for All-Stars of Service.

First and foremost, I'm 32 and still don't know how to dress. In fact, the majority of my wardrobe consists of over-sized shirts from my childhood complete with copious holes and wrinkles. But my amazing girlfriend (who handles the slobbery like a champ), turned me on to ASOS.

My friends are getting married. I'm a big boy. It's time to buy suits. I ordered two packages from ASOS on Black Friday. One made it to my apartment (faster than expected) while the other went missing. Upon opening the only package I actually received, I discovered that the clothes fit well. Maybe even too well. So, I was really excited about my second package but it never came. After trading multiple calls with post offices and my landlord, ASOS was there to assist me every step of the way. I reached out to them via Facebook and the response time was minimal.

They proposed a solution: Initially, they agreed to reship everything I had purchased but unfortunately, the items I had bought were no longer available in my size. (I suppose my boo has good taste.)

From the MIA order, ASOS is sending me one shirt and refunding me for everything else. As sad as I am to not have received my second package, I'm extremely relieved to know ASOS is good people. They saw everything through and never doubted me from the start.

High marks all around, as I don't blame the delivery issues on you.",5,ASOS,1

There was a little mixup with my order and my return, but in the end I got the most perfect dress I loved and returned the ones that didn't work out. ASOS was so nice about the whole thing and they even gave me my dress I wore that day for free as a wedding present to keep, which was a total surprise!

It will need some alterations and additions because the material is a bit thin, but overall I’m ecstatic  that I found a wedding dress for $200. I searched several wedding dress shops for $1,000+ dresses and didn’t find one I liked as much as the Asos one. The size finder is great and all five I ordered fit perfectly. I wish that the website allowed for photo reviews so other brides could see how they look in person.",5,ASOS,1

Filipe Barros,2019-11-28T14:46:52Z,Friendly Help Assistance,"I ordered twice from ASOS without any problem so far. The orders arrived at the estimated date and the package was fine.

On my last order I made a mistake, ordered the same item twice, so I requested help from an assistant. Sadly they could not update the order (even if it was done 10 minutes ago), but Denisa (a very helpful and friendly assistant) made clear what steps should be taken next (returning process). Since it was definitely my mistake, I cannot blame ASOS, but the fact they will refund you after you freely return an item (in proper condition) it is a plus!

Next time (there will be another time, obviously) I have to checkout more carefully, I guess! :)

Cheers",5,ASOS,1

Also with Sandals I would love if not only they had heel size in the description but also platform height measurement. 
And the last thing...If there is something I absolutely love and its not in my size as it has sold out - I would love an option to put myself on a wait-list if someone returns it -that you can be in a queue for that item.",5,ASOS,1

However, Asos' policy on making a return once you've used a promo code is outdated and basically stealing. I used a promo code for $70 off an order over $250. I received a pair of pants that didn't fit and was in a different hardware color than the ones I ordered. I returned the pants with the intention of ordering a different size and correct hardware, but was told I wouldn't receive a refund or the correct pants due to the Terms and Conditions of the promo code. Asos this is stealing. I gave you back the pants I paid for to receive nothing in return? You all should either split the $70 amongst the three items I purchased -$23.33 each item or allow customers in the US to make exchanges. This is ridiculous. I've shopped with you all for years and I've never been so disappointed. Only gave 5 stars for Sugra.",5,ASOS,1

Bill,2019-11-25T22:56:20Z,At the beginning I came in fuming,"At the beginning I came in fuming, angry and totally upset with previous agent I spoke with in regards to un-met delivery date . I understand that some dates can’t be met but telling a customer to wait additional 20 days to receive their items is not right . This should be communicated at the shipment page where customer have the expectation  to wait till the final eta date . Possibly , mention ETA AT THE EARLIEST nov 18 instead of advising that I am going to get my items on that day. People plan around suggested dates and other dates to meet your eta . When projected dates are not met and told to wait an additional 20 extra days it leave a sour taste in consumers mouths of how ASOS runs their business. 

2. )  please refrain from using “ We have made every effort to accommodate your shipping “ - why ? - because it’s a lie. A hoax and it’s bad business . - I was only provided 1 tracking number . That tracking number was not updated since the day of dispatch which means there was no effort made to update information .  Consumers look at this information as valuable information . 
 
3 ) ASOS. Employees sound like automated system.  They are not empathetic in any way and are inconsiderate . They sound like robots and I HATE TALKING TO ROBOTS . 

In conclusion - The customer services was terrible and you don’t make any effort to make things easier for your consumer. You should allow customer to have more control online then having them clog the que . Wait times like 30 minutes to answer a chat is ridiculous. I would not recommend other e commerce consumers to shop at ASOS. 
I spoke with ASHA - she was great and turned around my poor experience. 

She great to talk to and it felt like a real person . I’m glad she assisted me and wanted to give her all the stars possible . She gave me options, understandings and made this POOR EXPERIENCE more tolerable . I’m glad I was able to speak with her . THANK YOU AASHA - YOUR AMAZING

The only why I rated the company 5 star because it helps team members there progress . My bad survey can hold them back . In terms of ASOS - your process sucks and it isn’t consumer friendly .",5,ASOS,1

But she was excellent she is the one that went above and beyond to contact FedEx etc. She did everything.   However the first girl Ravika was horrible. She wanted me to wait a couple of days.  The girl who got everything done and organized was the best. She contacted FedEx and everything because FedEx wanted to get ahold of you. The number they had for shipping just kept ringing. Get rid of Ravika. Horrible.   Thanks to the second person for all her accomplished efforts and patience.,5,ASOS,1

Alys Johnston,2019-09-30T16:54:10Z,Big big confidence boost.,"I need to give the biggest praise to some products I bought from here. 
So I'm not the smallest bust. I struggle to find a bra that's; comfy, sexy and covers me and supports me. 
So I had heard about the bralette from ASOS that did fit plus size chests. 
I was a bit suspicious to start with but thought why not try it.
Well first off when looking online and seeing woman with all types of normal bodies and no sign of photo shop made me feel so much happier buying from there. 
I then get my bralettes looking at them I thought 'oh nope they won't fit I'm just at square one'. 
I tried them on, BEST FIT EVER! 
Honestly I couldn't think of a better fitting bra. One from figleaves and the others from ASOS. 
Goodbye under wire hello sexy new bralettes. 
ASOS you have outdone yourself. 
Girls with big boobs and are curvy trust me you won't regret these at all.",5,ASOS,1

I reached out with my order # and tracking # and was told they usually take 10 business days so to check back if I hadn’t gotten an email confirming my return in a couple days. I did just that and still no email so I followed up. Jodie looked at the file and could see I had already reached out once and sent my return for manual processing right away. Very shortly thereafter I received an email saying my return had been issued a refund. This was seamless compared to other online return issues I have had with other companies.

I’m just 20 weeks and all of a sudden nothing fits me!! I also have no clue what size I am, hence online shopping hasn’t been my friend! I ordered a skirt and two dresses, turns out I’m a 10 not 12 and two of the items just didn’t fit well. Arranging returns was SO easy, and I only dropped to the post office today and I’ve already gotten a refund! I did order a few more items today, hopefully in the right size!!

RE TRAKPAK

My suggestions should STOP TrackPak as the forwarding agent for your international delivery. 
They screwed up. The previous order 425456392 I didn't get the parcel at ALL and I've waive the payment as ASOS has done all the possibility to assist me. 

I do hope ASOS logistic team can look into this matter thoroughly.

In the meantime, he provided me with information about how I could still return items that I did not want to keep as I didn’t not have the delivery note with the returns information. Very helpful, very polite and I appreciate his help immensely. Hopefully this will be resolved quickly and I can confidently shop with ASOS still, as I have done for years.

Jenn,2019-10-20T00:27:22Z,"Online ASOS chat with Nifé. Reference# 23114535 - one of the most kind, helpful, valuable positive customer service interactions I have had in a long time!!!","Today I had the pleasure of chatting online with a very kind ASOS employee, named Nifé, chat reference #23114535. As I mentioned in the title already, yet is indeed absolutely worth noting again, that this person definitely gave me one of the most positive customer service interactions that I have had in quite a long time. This holds true to all of my customer service, whether it be through a chat, phone call, e-mail, or in person. I purchase a lot of clothes, make up, skincare, and haircare from varied, diverse companies. After selling our first house, not too long ago  and upgrading to a much larger home, we have dealt with numerous furniture companies, and countless of places that sell any related items needed/wanted, for the inside of a home. Furthermore, our property is large, so we also dealt with tons of companies when it came to upgrading the sunroom, different things needed for an in ground pool, grass maintenance and everything in between. One thing worth stating for the purpose of the review is our new home is twice the size of our old home (4 additional rooms then our old house, which we left fully furnished) and having to buy different things we didn't need previously. Needless to say, the amount of customer service experience I have is vast and I have dealt with far more bad then good,and sometimes ok. I had very rude encounters with customer service/management from places I spent thousands in, and many horrible experiences was after being a customer for many years in some places. Today, I chatted with Nifé from ASOS and was treated with respect and addressed all my questions 100% and remained kind the whole time. I rarely write these reviews, but I believe it should be noted that your employee is dedicated to doing his job beyond what is required, and answered all my questions fully, with extra useful information. Nifé was a breath of fresh air, and I hope he/she is appreciated for their outstanding work ethic, excellent manners, and ability to over excel at ASOS, while remaining completely professional, courteous, and shows he/she is happy to help!

I have had some issues with asos customer service in the past, but thankfully Nadine was able to bring it back with a refreshing and helpful attitude, as well as helping me to over come a life long self confidence issue with my clown sized feet. Asos team, please kindly promote young nadine and or increase her pay grade as us big footed women need to spend a lot more money on shoes than those frustrating women who fit into junior sizes.",5,ASOS,1

Ivy Greene,2019-10-04T23:37:17Z,I love ASOS,"I was looking for ASOS product reviews and found this website. I do not understand all the hate. Yeah they have some odd items, but a lot of their stuff is really cool, and the sales are frequent and make it easy to save on unique stuff. ASOS is the site I use the most to shop online mostly because they offer free shipping on orders of $50+ and free return shipping, so you have nothing to lose in trying stuff out. I live in the states and have never waited more than a few days for a package. For this reason I don't pay for premium shipping. I also do not order clothes 2 days before I need them, so maybe that is why it is not an issue for me. I have never had a problem getting refunds for items I return. You have A MONTH to decide on things. If you return them after trying them on, but they are in unworn condition (tags on, no stains, rips, perfume, etc), there is no hassle in getting your money back. The only thing I wish they offered is customer reviews on products, although their style guide is pretty accurate if you are honest about your measurements. Anytime I have talked to customer service about anything they have been friendly and helpful. Just one girl's opinion, but these reviews do not reflect my experience with ASOS at all.",5,ASOS,1

They also listen to customer feedback. I'm a big girl and there was a time where there were these cute outfits that was only available for small sizes. I wrote some feedback asking them if they could also make these outfits available for bigger sizes and a couple of months later when I was checking their site, I saw those outfits in bigger sizes. I also see that they are making more of an effort to have the same clothing item in a larger variety of sizes. They also have more promo code sales than before. 
Honestly I feel that Asos is one of the only companies out there that really care about their customers and also willing to listen to feedback.",5,ASOS,1

As well as this there should also be pictures (maybe liked to Instagram or other socials) showing real life people wearing and using the products - not everyone has the body type of an asos model!

Shaun Worth,2019-10-10T13:54:16Z,Yodel sucks. Kirsti rocks.,"It begins badly. Had a bloody awful experience with Yodel (the delivery firm), who flat-out lied about attempting to drop off my parcel. Tried every customer service channel but couldn't get through to anyone real. Pathetic.

So, more in hope than expectation, I used the ASOS web chat. Within three minutes Kirsti had contacted Yodel, got an investigation raised, and instructed tomorrow's driver to call me as they're dropping the parcel off. All while being thoroughly charming, reassuring and classy. 

The gulf between ASOS and Yodel is astonishing. They've literally done their customer service for them. (Dear Christ.)

Anyway, Kirsti is a star. Thanks, Kirsti – show 'em how it's done!",5,ASOS,1

Grayson Strange,2019-10-03T18:12:30Z,Easy purchase and super fast delivery,"Easy purchase and super fast delivery.  I did have an issue with shipping, which was my fault.  When I set up my profile I used the address finder, and found my address.  However it used avenue instead of street, which I missed.  This address doesn’t actually exist, even though google maps shows it.  There is a number that is close, but not the address.  FedEx delivered it to this incorrect address.  This meant that unless the person who received package returned it to ASOS, I would be out the money and the clothes.  Not a great situation for me.  Moral of the story is pay attention when you are setting up your account!  Fortunately I went knocking on peoples doors on that block like a crazy person until I tracked down the package.

I texted with Amy in customer support who was quick and responsive, but because it was my fault, there was nothing ASOS could do.  Thank you for the help Amy!  I would order from them again.",5,ASOS,1

I’m not usually in so I ask to have my parcels left in a safe place or with a neighbour and they always are! It’s usually the same driver as well so he knows where to leave it and always puts a card through the door (with a smiley face!) to let me know! The tracking is useful and returns are free and easy!

My pants fit perfect, just how I like them. Super comfortable. Good quality. Got 2 day free shipping because of how much I spent. I also bought a sweatshirt. Super soft, also good quality.

It is only when things go badly that people decide they must voice their experience, which is understandable.

I must therefore say ASOS is my most favoured shop! I have probably ordered about 100 items from them over the years, and have experienced problems on 1 or 2 occasions. Considering the amount of orders they process, it is naive to expect them to get it right every single time- unless you'd prefer humans removed and computers doing all the work instead?!

For example, I purchased a bag Wednesday evening using standard delivery (19th December) it has just arrived 5 minutes ago (21st December) so it would appear the delivery is very hit or miss as I am seeing volumes of people saying their order hasn't been dispatched 10 days after purchase.

Overall in the 3 to 4 times I have used ASOS they have yet to disappoint me as they offer some of the best (if not the best) prices in the market, only thing I would say I do find mildly concerning is that the delivery (at least for standard) is by MyHermes and while they have done superbly the last 4 times, to say I have had a bumpy ride with them in the past would be an understatement so please do be cautious.",5,ASOS,1

I'm DJ transaction. You can check me out in Instagram. I stumbled into asos because I was searching for a cotton/linen suit and asos was the first search result. I see the pics on the website and they look great. The prices were dirt cheap. Then I did some research and came here. I saw many negative reviews. But I decided to take a risk; I also saw a suit I really wanted for dirt cheap. I bought it Feb 16 2019 with $3 extra for shipping. Today is Feb 22 and it just arrived.

Some of these other people need to be reasonable and not expect big gift cards every time something is delayed or something similar (which isn’t often.) you’re already getting free returns and FREE next day delivery for a year for under £10. Never received a damaged item either. They’re also very lenient with their returns, unlike some others. Don’t listen to some of these reviews bashing them about it, I get the feeling they’re the sort to order 10 items, return 9, 3 weeks later after wearing them and then complain that they’re not accepted for being worn, damaged, stained etc. If this is your first time ordering from ASOS you won’t be disappointed.",5,ASOS,1

Firstly being charged for an item that I didn’t receive, and secondly for an item I returned that was faulty. This wasn’t acknowledged and so I hadn’t received a refund for that either. Then, at last today Megan has come through.. in her shiny suit of armour riding a horse and brandishing a sword and saved the day issuing refunds for both of the items! Hurrah!!! We got there in the end.. where was Megan at the start of these conversations. The problem is that customer services pick up random emails so not all my emails were obviously read by the previous customer service agents until today. ASOS as a company generally are great! Never had issues with them like this before, and I’m always ordering off them. Such an amazing amount of clothes and beauty products as well as home (but mainly clothes for me!)

Regarding delivery, I would prefer if ASOS provides working tracking numbers when shipping items, in addition to the method they will be using to ship items. I ordered something once before to be shipped to the Caribbean and the order showed it would be shipped regular post however it ended up being post through DHL without ASOS asking or advising me and that incurred $300 in duties which I had to pay.

Stella,2019-12-07T04:37:01Z,I LOVE ASOS,"I LOVE ASOS! I have only recently started shopping online. I'm an artist and work from home, so buying clothes has not always been a priority for me. However I had to attend a swish wedding so checked out all the sites. Asos is definitely the best in my humble opinion. I like all their brands, but I LOVE the ASOS brand..in terms of being incredibly chic, the colours, style and even the photography and poses of the models are better...other fashion sites seem really tacky by comparison. And the asos website is simple and clear in terms of graphics and text,, and easy to use. And affordable, especially with Afterpay. All my orders have arrived without a problem from the UK, and more quickly than sending a parcel from Tasmania to Sydney..I know this sounds gushy but I am absolutely thrilled to have discovered asos and won't bother shopping anywhere else, online or instore.",5,ASOS,2

Kathia.,2019-10-07T13:00:50Z,Taking Care Of Customers When The Brands They Stock Fails Customers,"I recently purchased a skirt from Kings Of Indigo via ASOS. A crucial button on the denim skirt fell off rendering the whole skirt unusable. The spare button wasn't included in this particular product even when their other products have them. I contacted KOI directly in hopes to salvage this skirt I had come to love and was let down by them. You would think a brand all about sustainability would understand the right to repair and keep a couple of spare denim buttons or at least suggested an alternative. They just gave me a ""Sorry we can't help you"" as the final point of the support. I contacted ASOS about this and it turns I was well within the returns period. I will very likely return it at the risk of never getting a replacement for this denim skirt I have come to love as it was bought on sale. Additionally, there is also a risk it will end up in a landfill after being returned. So this brand I bought based on its sustainability cred has just majorly let me down. But thank you ASOS support for giving me an option for recourse.",5,ASOS,2

My returns are always received and promptly procesed. Custumer service always replies on their chat platform and are always nice and helpful. I really don’t understand how some people have so many issues with them. Regarding quality of their products, some are good, some are bad, it is a fast fashion brand.",5,ASOS,2

I forgot to this time and it took around 3 weeks to arrive. It was two days later than the expected delivery date, but everything was great and fit perfectly!

I live near a major shipping hub (Toronto) so often my deliveries are faster than if I were to live in the suburbs.

Asos customer service were able to get back to me within a day when I asked about the status of my order. Honestly I have not had a problem with them yet - even when I had to return an item. So I don't know if people on here are really impatient or what.

If you live in Canada and order standard shipping, around a month is normal waiting time. Always buy things online with a credit card so you can dispute it, if it really takes too long.",5,ASOS,2

Website 
- Using the ASOS website is just a pleasure. The search engine can be as detailed or as succinct as you like and the filters on the page made the online shopping experience worth it. I guess my favourite aspect of shopping at ASOS is seeing the video of the product on the catwalk. It allows me to visualise how it would look on me. 

Clothes
- ASOS own design clothes are of good high street quality. The fabric (usually synthetic fibres) is robust and stylish at the same time. 

- Modest fashion. ASOS is starting out on this and that's great. I cannot wait for the ASOS to be able to compete with foreign online retailers and push out the competition. 

- My only suggestion would be is that the clothes would have individual measurements (like Shein) making it easier to pick a size. I'm usually between size 8, 10 and 12 and knowing the garment measurements would be a relief. 

Ordering and delivery
- It takes seconds to order on ASOS especially if you've ordered before. The delivery (I go for the free standard five day delivery option) is usually sooner than the expected date.

Returns and exchanges
- The returns are easy and fast. It took less than a week for my return to be processed and order to be refunded to my account. 

- The exchanges are just as easy, on my returns form I ticked exchange the other size arrived within a few working days.",5,ASOS,3

Tracey Mazzarella,2019-12-28T18:17:29Z,5 star amazing service by Team Asos,"5 star amazing service by the customer care team. After the Christmas ""Crazies"" on Christmas Eve, I jumped on to purchase a gift card and I completely botched the recipiants email address. To my horror Christmas lunchtime I discovered my mistake when my nephew announced he had not received his gift card email. 
I jumped on immediately to the customer care area - not expecting much at all being Christmas Day - followed by the Boxing Day mayhem (which with such an amazing sale I wanted my nephew to be able to participate in). 
Within 24 hours and the biggest craziest time of the year, the problem that ""I created"" was fixed by customer service and my nephew was happily shopping the Boxing Day sales.
The communication by the customer care team was outstanding each step of the resolution. The friendliness, professionalism and prompt replies was such a pleasant experience and surprise.
Thank you ASOS for being outstanding and going over and beyond to fix this for me so quickly. We were back shopping in no time and will not hesitate to continue to come back and also let everyone know loud and clear what an amazing company to deal with you all are.
Thank you for helping make our Christmas Merry.

If something isn't right it's very easy to return, and so much of their stuff is wonderful. They even recently have begun stocking my favourite makeup brand which can be hard to find in the UK. The quality of the clothes does vary a lot, but this is because they stock so many brands. I've found their own brand to be very good quality. Customer service is also very efficient. Recently an item was missing from my order (the first time in about 7-8+ years of using them!) and they sent it again for me no problem. The only other problem I've had is when I ordered some shoes (not Asos own - another brand) with what was clearly stated to be ""fake"" fur on. However upon arrival I could tell it was definitely real fur. I told them, and they said it was against their policy and they would check the item themselves, and when I looked only a day or so later, the item had been pulled from their site, well done ASOS! I also like that you have the option to show only non-leather items (or the opposite), and you can search for sustainable items. My only crit is that sometimes what items such as shoes are made of can be a little vague, I would appreciate more detail there, it can be hard to know if items are vegan friendly. I hope they continue to further their sustainability and search terms. All the staff I have ever interacted with have been nothing short of lovely, efficient and helpful (Thank you Christine for sorting out my missing item today!) I will continue to use ASOS for many years to come.",5,ASOS,3

Unfortunately he decided to show it as being delivered and signed for on their tracking system! I spoke to a really helpful a called Daisy online this evening and she was very reassuring that it would work it's way back through their system in 24 hours. Despite this not being resolved entirely to my satisfaction (yet) I was impressed with how easy it was to speak to someone who knew what they were talking about.

Nor,2019-08-15T10:50:30Z,I’m genuinely shocked at all the bad reviews.,"I love asos. 
My next day deliveries 99.9% of the time have arrived on time and any returns sorted rapidly!
Only problems I’ve had in the past was when I’ve ordered some jeans that seemed like they’d already been worn, and some items that aren’t asos own, are cheaply made. 
And I always find the website really boring to navigate, there is so much stuff it takes days to find anything that you actually like even with filtered searches. 
All the items and orders (21 out of 22) I’ve made recently have been top notch.",5,ASOS,3

I have collected two orders from them so far and everything seems to be fine. The size guide is also a good way to determine your size. The only instance when it didn't work was on an Oasis dress but my lack of boobs seemed to be the problem there. There are certainly problems with ASOS being a fast-fashion distributor, but while my budget is limited -  ASOS is one of the best ways to clothe myself :)",5,ASOS,3

I've ordered off ASOS a few times and never had any issues before but the most recent order that I placed I had delivered to my local parcel shop, the order said it had all arrived but yet when I received it half was missing. I opened an online chat with someone who passed my case onto a specialist and said they would be in touch within 24 hours (after reading the bad reviews I was very scared I would not received my items at all) . 2 hours later I had been contacted by email to apologise for the delay and that I would have the rest of my items dispatched with next day delivery. The items arrived next day as stated and all my items were there. Yes, there was a little glitch to begin with but I can honestly say it does not put me off using them and I will certainly be buying the delivery pass in future!",5,ASOS,3

But I'm aware that , although the offer is vast, the quality of ASOS made products leaves a lot to be desired. Of course you get what you paid for, cheap ! Also I find that Asos has lost its lustre by providing merchandise not so exciting as before, stuff that one can just find anywhere on line. I suggest that asos should hire streets ahead buyers, because going through the massive stuff on site, it's difficult to find something that stands out and worth buying, just me of course.  I lately got a pair of of Allsaints cigarette jeans, a winner. Thanx.",5,ASOS,3

Gracious275,2019-12-21T03:54:40Z,"5 Stars due to the CS Help from Waqar, 1 Star if solely based on Hermes Delivery!","I am a weekly shopper with ASOS. I’ve found it difficult to decide what star rating to give at the moment. If my parcels are delivered by courier with DPD every time (Like they used to with Premier Delivery) I would easily give an overall company rating of 5 stars. Based on delivery and fixed systems making it impossible to give me a replacement order without me having to re-pay for my items when it wasn’t my fault it was not delivered 1/5.
Using Next Day Delivery I find my orders now mostly get sent out with Hermes. If I don’t get my usual lovely Hermes courier, I have had to wait weeks for my order to arrive if it even makes it! Most of the time with Hermes my orders gets lost or instantly returned to the ASOS warehouse with no accurate explanation. Which means all my items go out of stock and leaves me miserable. I then have to wait to get my money back from ASOS and then wait for the items to come back into stock to order them again.
Usually Customer Service at ASOS is brilliant although recently under the added pressure of Christmas I have had a less than satisfactory wait time and have been faced with equally stressed and sometimes sharp tongued CS team members failing to help me due to automated responses and just not being able to follow the previous conversations with other agents.
However it’s late at night, I’m ill and have just been in contact with CS about my parcel problems again and was actually helped (going above and beyond) by the lovely Waqar. They are a complete credit to the ASOS CS team, and not only resolved my problems and queries but also explained how things worked. They equally cheered me up this late in the morning, as I’d started to cry in distress of the situation. Thank you so so much, you most certainly deserve a huge reward for handling my case with care, sensitivity and appropriate humour when needed. I appreciate it greatly and you taking my feedback seriously and passing it on, it’s saved me from never ordering from ASOS again as you’ve restored my faith in humanity! - A massive 5/5 Stars for you!! 😁",5,ASOS,4

If anything I've experienced quite the opposite, a couple of times my order has even arrived earlier than expected. 

Just finished talking to customer service, unfortunately I made a mistake in returning my order, but even though it was my own mistake, the ASOS team didn't hesitate to go out of their way to create a whole new return note for me, and guide me through what I had to do step for step. 

Easy to say that I am beyond impressed time and time again by this company.

I am very thoroughly pleased and happy about the experiences I've had with this trustworthy company. I can only wholeheartedly recommend this company to anyone who is in need of, great, cheap, durable clothes delivered quickly at your own home, with easy returns, and full refunds. 

Absolute best regards,

However! I have not used their services since they’ve put in place their new returns policy (which is to prevent people wearing clothes and then returning them) so I’m not too sure but I have faith in their customer service that they would fix it if there was ever a problem.",5,ASOS,4

I paid for Express Delivery which is £9.99 for 12 months and can say that ASOS have never let me down. 

Unlike other online stores, the return process is easy and well managed as there are a great many options for returns which is very convenient. Once they receive your item, they send an email confirmation, and adivse when your money will be refunded.

My number one shopping brand, as they are prompt with good value for money and a knowledgeable customer service team.",5,ASOS,4

I’ve returned a lot of stuff and that’s never been an issue either. Always got my money, parcels never gone missing etc. Just keep your returns receipt just in case and they will still refund you the money. Couldn’t fault the company at all. I liked Asos a list when they had it also as I got a few vouchers out of it. I ordered something on next day delivery once and it didn’t turn up the next day, however I contacted them and they gave me my postage money back without bother! No issues. Would recommend.",5,ASOS,4

On top of this, shipping is insanely fast. If there's a huge sale though (e.g. Black Friday), expect a slight delay, which I have experienced. But other than that, I'm impressed with the quality, service and shipping speed - most of my orders have arrived 3 days before the expected delivery date, which keeps me coming back to shopping with ASOS as well.

Based on my experience so far, I recommend shopping at ASOS, especially when it comes to their sales.",5,ASOS,4

But....ASOS, if you're listening, please PLEASE stop using Hermes. They are absolutely useless and are damaging your brand by association. They are so irresponsible and useless to deal with( the fact that you can't actually contact them and they refer you back to the retailer is ridiculous), and honestly you are so much better than that. They may be more expensive but DPD, SO much better. I would rather pay more for my premier subscription for the better service they offer. They are beyond awesome and uphold the great customer experience that you guys provide before handing our packages over. You're winning at everything - but this ruins the customer journey right at the very end which is such a shame. I used to love ordering knowing my package would be delivered by DPD, but now its like Russian Roulette as to whether it'll arrive (just ask my two current MIA packages).

I've had every refund processed properly. I received one incorrect item and they sorted it immediately. I received a parcel so badly damaged not all the items were in it and they rectified that immediately (they sent a cardboard box instead of their plastic bags - ASOS stick with the bags please!). They are often more expensive than other places but I think you are paying for the customer service and free delivery and quality of how they advertise their products (videos). I only don't shop with them now since their rewards scheme ended and I suspect they have lost other people's business because of this as it looks lately like their profits had taken a down turn. Bring back the points scheme/rewards scheme ASOS!,5,ASOS,5

I did this ordered yesterday late morning and it arrived in the UK at 13.00pm what amazing service and super quick delivery! Next working day delivery and package was shipped with DHL from Germany!

I have bought more than 20 products (including t-shirts, shirts, shoes, sunglasses, glasses, caps, jackets, bags, shocks). Just only one was not what I really expected and that was my first buy from asos one year ago it was a jacket, it was poor quality.

I saw people blame ASOS for delivery issues when they should have contacted the company which was delivering it. I also noticed that people couldn't seem to read the sizes and blame ASOS for custom costs when they should have been aware themselves... Most common of all is of people buying clothes a day before they need them and moan that it hadn't arrived.. how about plan in advance.
My delivery arrived before the time specified, and the quality of the items was good especially for what I've pay for it. Overall I am happy with the experience and would use them again.",5,ASOS,10

As a busy customer with little time for getting to a major city to spend the day walking round stores this is ideal. Had 1 issue on a delivery in about 12 years and ASOS sent a replacement order (although the service was a little slow on this). However mistakes happen and if it one in 100 orders then I don't have an issue. Bought plenty of ASOS own label stuff too which are normally a great price too. Quality not the same as designer, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Stock plenty of brands too from high street to your Ralph Lauren's etc",5,ASOS,17

P.B,2019-02-15T16:20:05Z,I decided to give ASOS a try,"I decided to give ASOS a try. First time with ASOS here.

I was super scared, highly sceptical and slightly hesitate about buying from ASOS as I came on here and read all the reviews , however, they do have a nice range of clothing which caught my eye.

When deciding to buy from ASOS and then reading these review, I had a feeling I might head into a shark infested waters.

While I did take all these reviews onboard, I decided to risk it and find out myself if the shopping experience with ASOS was as challenging as most of these shopper have mentioned here. 

I think, as I am based in the UK, orders might be better for UK residents as are a UK business and are actually based in the UK. I may only assume people buying overseas might get challenging issues with shipments and orders with ASOS as there is a distance with deliveries.

I wrote to the chat box of ASOS and chatted with a person from ASOS voicing my concerns about ordering from ASOS. He was very reassuring my order would arrive and I shouldn't be worried.

I order three items and they all came - even arrived early. ASOS constantly informed me by email where my order was on route. Yodel delivered the items and were very friendly also sending me text letting me know where my items were. 

I had order two pair of shoes and a dress. The dress was great, size was good which means ASOS is true to their size charts for me. One pair of the shoes were fabulous however the second pair( fabulous too!) were a tad too small. Nothing wrong with the shoes, my feet are a bit wide, hence one pair crammed my feet.

So I embarked on the return. This is where I was a bit scared after reading the reviews and thought maybe this is were ASOS was going to be a bit of a nightmare. 

Followed the instructions, returned it by free post via Royal Mail. They offer other options for free delivery, however, to be honest, I feel Royal Mail is the safest. Within 2 days, I got an email stating they received my returned item and my refund will be processed shortly. Within 2 days my full refund was in my account.

While it looks like many people who have left reviews here , have had a challenging time with ASOS, Im glad I took the plunge and did buy from them. 

Overall, my experience has been excellent with ASOS and I hope to buy from them again.",5,ASOS,22

I order constantly and the app is so easy to use. Tracks my delivery. Returns are the easiest ever-even small things like resealable bags, tick boxes for returns, quick refunds etc
The variety of items is brilliant! It’s not often I can’t find what I want from self tan to river island jeans.
